Submitted fresh specimen A is labeled LEFT KIDNEY PARENCHYMA FS and consists of two pieces of yellow maroon tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  The resubmitted frozen section tissue is totally embedded in cassette A. B.     Submitted in formalin specimen B is labeled COLON and consists of a colon segment 73 cm in length x a diameter ranging from 2.5 up to 3.5 cm. The serosal area is light tan  pink maroon with a small area of serosal fibrosis.  Opening the colon displays an ulcerating and polypoid circumferential mass measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and extends to within 4.5 cm of the nearest margin.  Prior to sectioning of the mass the serosal margin is inked in black.    Sections display the mass to extend through the muscularis propria and focally into pericolonic adipose tissue.  On the antimesenteric side the tumor appears to focally extend to the subserosa without definitive serosal involvment.  The remaining colon displays approximately the five small polyps ranging from 0.3 up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  In addition a central mucosal area with green discoloration is identified measuring 0.9 cm in dimension.  Small diverticula are also grossly seen.  No additional masses are grossly identified.  An additional portion of omentum is identified in the specimen container measuring 19.5 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm.  Sectioning shows no gross abnormalities.    Sections of the tumor mass are submitted in cassettes B1  B4, a section of the nearest margin is submitted in cassette B5, sections of the additional mucosal polyps are submitted in cassette B6, sections of diverticula and green gangrenous area are submitted in cassette B7, section of omentum is submitted in cassette B8, three possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassette B9, a single piece of fibroadipose tissue with associated vascular structures and possible positive lymph nodes is submitted in cassette B10, and additional possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes B11- B14. C.     Submitted in formalin specimen C is labeled COLON POLYP and consists of a large mucosal polyp measuring 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm. Sectioning shows a friable polyp without definitive evidence of gross invasion.  Specimen is totally embedded in cassettes C1  C4. D.     Submitted in formalin specimen D is labeled COLON DONUT and consists of two pieces of focally sutured colon segments measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm.  Sections are submitted in cassette D. GAR Intraoperative Consultation(s) Frozen section diagnosis: A. Adipose tissue with fibrosis, inflammation and histiocytes.  Negative for malignancy. (GAR).\nMicroscopic Description A.          Permanent sections of the resubmitted frozen section tissue shows adipose tissue with areas of fat necrosis, fibrosis, mild to moderate acute and chronic inflammation with hemosiderin ladened macrophages and associated blood.  No evidence of malignancy is seen. B.     Sections of the submitted colon tumor shows irregular tortuous, cystically dilated and cribriforming malignant glands showing significant nuclear pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei showing occasional inconspicuous nucleoli, minimal pseudostratification and areas of central necrosis consistent with a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The tumor is seen extending through the muscularis propria and into the pericolonic adipose tissue and elicits a minimal to moderate lymphocytic response.  Occasional areas suspicious for lymphovascular invasion are seen.  The serosal margins are free of involvement. A section of the nearest proximal margin is negative for malignancy.  Sections of the additional mucosal polyps display additional tubular adenomas with mild dysplasia and hyperplastic polyps.  No evidence of additional evidence of malignancy is seen.  Sections of the diverticuli display a single diverticulus with associated adipose tissue showing a benign lymphoid aggregate.  Additionally, an area of green discoloration shows associated necrosis with significant acute inflammation, edema and muscularis degeneration.  No evidence of malignancy is seen. A section of the omentum shows no significant histopathologic abnormalities.  Sections of the submitted lymph nodes display the palpable lymph node to be replaced by malignant glands consistent with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma. Sections of the remaining lymph nodes display an additional twelve lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma. C.     Sections of the totally embedded mucosal polyps show the polyp to display a tubular and villous architectural pattern with surface epithelium showing nuclear hyperchromasia, pseudostratification and moderate loss of basal nuclear orientation.  Mild stroma edema with chronic inflammatory cells is seen.  No evidence of invasive malignancy is seen.  The stalk and cauterized resected margin shows hyperplastic changes without evidence of adenomatous dysplasia or malignancy. D.     Sections of the specimen designated colon donut shows portions of colon with areas of hyperplastic mucosa.  Minimal vascular congestion, mild stroma edema is seen.  No evidence of malignancy is identified.\nSpecimen Source:   \\S\\kidney bx left parenchema\\T\\Colon, segmental resection: for tumor.\\T\\Colon, polyp.\\T\\Colon, biopsy:donut\\S\\\\S\\0  \n"

The specimen measures 4.6 x 2.5 x 3.1 cm.  The nodule measures 4.3 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm.  The surgical resection margins are inked.  The external surface is red and smooth.  Sections through the gland show a well circumscribed, tan nodule with a partial definite capsule.  The nodule has a granular, yellow tan cut surface.  Scrape preps are prepared.  A representative portion is submitted for frozen section in cassette FS.  FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  PAPILLARY CARCINOMA.  Results called to Dr. **NAME[YYY] on **DATE[Nov 05 11] at 2:00 p.m.  Additional sections of the tumor are submitted in cassettes A thru F.  DT: **DATE[Nov 05 11]  Part 2 is received in formalin designated \\\"right thyroid gland\\\" is a lobe of tan thyroid tissue weighing 6 grams and measuring 4.5 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm.  The surgical resection margins are inked.  The cut surface is homogeneous, red and tan.  The entire lobe is submitted in cassettes #2A thru #2F.  DT: **DATE[Nov 06 11]\nMICRO: Sections from the left lobe of the gland show a partially encapsulated 4.3 cm focus of papillary carcinoma.  The tumor is limited to the thyroid gland and does not involve the surgical resection margins.  The tumor is composed of complex, branching, and randomly oriented papillae with a lining of cuboidal cells.  The nuclear features of papillary carcinoma are present.  A few cells demonstrate nuclear grooves and many cells demonstrate ground glass nuclei.  Psammoma bodies are also present.  A single normal parathyroid gland is identified.DT: **DATE[Nov 06 11] (DRB, bsp)  Sections from the right lobe of the thyroid show a well-circumscribed follicular nodule with a fibrous capsule.  This nodule most likely represents a follicular adenoma. Sections adjacent to the nodule show benign thyroid parenchyma with focal chronic inflammation.  There is no evidence of papillary carcinoma or follicular carcinoma in the right thyroid lobe.  DT: **DATE[Nov 07 11] (DRB, bsp)\nPROCEDURE: Total thyroidectomy.

Results are outlined in the\ntable below:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nTTF-1     Positive\nCK7  Positive\nCK20 Positive\n\nImpression:  This staining pattern is consistent with a lung primary.\nThis pattern is most often associated with a mixed bronchoalveolar or\nmucinous adenocarcinoma.\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[XXX M. WWW] M.D.\nComment:  Immunohistochemical stains are performed to further\ncharacterize the tumor.\n\nThe immunohistochemical tests reported were developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by CellNetix Labs, LLC.  Some tests have not\nbeen cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The\nFDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nThese tests may be used for clinical purposes.  They should not be\nregarded as investigational or for research use only.  CellNetix Labs,\nLLC is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of\n1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory\ntesting.\n\nINTRADEPARTMENTAL CONSULTATION:\n**NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], M.D.\n\nPHYSICIAN NOTIFICATION:\nThe finding of adenocarcinoma in this biopsy was reported to Dr. **NAME[VVV] by\ntelephone on **DATE[May 15 12] at 2:25 p.m. by Dr. **NAME[WWW].\n\n**NAME[XXX M. WWW], M.D.  Electronically signed **DATE[May 15 2012]\n\n<ADDENDUM>  #1\n\nEGFR MUTATION ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR (PCR) REPORT:\nTesting performed by: **PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE, report\n***PATH-NUMBER[2],\nissued **DATE[May 17 2012].\nInterpreted by: **NAME[UUU TTT], M.D.\n\nResult: Left Lung Mass, Core Biopsy:  Negative for an EGFR mutation by\nreal time PCR (see Comments).\n\nComment: In this case no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\nmutations were identified by Quigen/DxS real time PCR. This real time\nPCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine\nkinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated\nfor non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of\nthis assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that\nthis assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,\nbut as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to\nother prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy.

Addendum Comment Since issuing the initial report we have stained the invasive component of tumor with P16 which is negative.  The overlying squamous epithelium shows patchy weak to moderate staining which is not diagnostic and the invasive carcinoma is completely negative. This militates against the tumor being HPV related. The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.

There are nodular\nand interstitial lymphoid infiltrates that consists of small mature\nlymphoid cells, comprising approximately 10-20% of marrow space on the clot\nsection.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: None\nSPECIAL STUDIES:\nFlow cytometric analysis performed. Flow cytometric analysis identifies 10%\nof total events as CD19 and CD20 positive B-cells co-expressing CD5, CD23\nand lambda light chain. CD38 is expressed on <30% of clonal B-cells. This\nimmunophenotype and limited morphologic findings are characteristic for\nCLL, or small lymphocytic lymphoma (with hematologic involvement if there\nis predominant lymphadenopathy). The absence of CD38 expression in CLL is\nassociated with better outcome. Cytogenetic analysis is pending.  Please\nsee separate report.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX. It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The staple line measures \n8 cm.  The pleural surfaces are inked black.  \n\nSections reveal a tan-white and firm circumscribed nodule measuring up to 2 cm in greatest dimension, and is within less than 0.5 cm from the nearest staple line.  Upon removal of staple line, the tumor is immediately adjacent and identified at the margin.  Adjacent sections are tan-gray with black tumor tissues, which grossly appears to be at the resection margin.  The mass does not appear to be grossly involving the pleural surface, however there appears to a torn or lacerated area adjacent the tumor.  The pleural parenchyma adjacent to the mass is predominantly tan-red and soft with scattered gray pigmentation.  No other firm masses or circumscribed lesions noted.  \n\nA representative section of the nodule is submitted for frozen section in one cassette.  All tumor sections submitted in cassettes A1 - A7, with the section of tumor nearest staple line in cassette A4.  Random sections in cassettes A8 - A10.\n\n(B)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 9 lymph node\" is a tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment measuring 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\n\n(C)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 10 lymph node\" is a tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\n\n(D)  Received fresh labeled \"level 10 lymph node\" is a 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment.  The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section in one cassette.\n\n(E)  Received fresh labeled \"right lower lobe (for bronchial margin)\" is a lung lobectomy specimen measuring 18 x 10 x 3 cm.  There are three staple lines measuring up to 12 cm.  The pleural surfaces are purple-red with scattered black and white pigmentation.  The surfaces are generally smooth.  On one edge of the lobe is a tan-white and soft unremarkable pleural parenchyma measuring 7 x 1.5 cm.  The stapled resection margins are inked black.  Sections reveal a predominantly maroon-red and soft pleural parenchyma with scattered gray-black and white spicules.  Areas along the staple line are predominantly dark maroon-red and homogeneous.  No circumscribed masses or lesions noted.  \n\nThe bronchial margins appear grossly unremarkable.  \n\nRepresentative sections are submitted in eleven cassettes, with the bronchial margin submitted for frozen section in cassette EFS.  Random sections from staple line in cassettes E1 and E2, random pleural parenchyma E3 - E9, and sections from bronchial margin in cassette E10. \n\n(F)  Received in formalin labeled \"4R lymph node\" are two red-brown, black and soft tissue fragments measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm.  The large fragment is bisected.  Submitted entirely in one cassette.\n\n(G)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 7 lymph node\" is a red-brown, black and soft tissue fragment measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA - G.

All internal and external controls were appropriately reactive.\nThe steroid receptor result is positive if at least 1% of tumor cell nuclei\nshow specific staining. For positive cases the \"fraction of cells staining\"\nis a visual estimate subject to observer variation. Her2 membrane\npositivity was scored according to **NAME[ZZZ] ASCP/CAP consensus (J Clin Oncol\n25:188, 2007):  0-1+ is negative for overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and\n3+ is positive.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 4.  Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[AAA BBB] and **DATE[Oct 22 1958]\nA.   Container designation: \"left breast\" --  The specimen consists of a 66\ngram, simple mastectomy specimen measuring 14.2 x 7.3 x up to 1.8 cm,\npartially surfaced with a 12 x 4.3 cm non-nipple bearing skin ellipse.  The\nspecimen is oriented with \"one clip superior\", \"two clips lateral\" and\n\"deep is on implant\" per the requisition slip.  The skin has two flat dark\nbrown lesions (0.3 and 0.5 cm) and two scars (a circular scar with a\ndiameter of 5.3 cm that has a second central 1.8 x 1.0 cm scar).  The\nspecimen is inked as follows: superior   red, inferior   green, medial\norange, lateral   yellow, anterior   skin, posterior   black.  Sectioning\nreveals a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm thickened possible lesion that abuts the\nnearest deep margin and is 5 mm from the nearest superior margin.  The\nremaining specimen is fatty with no significant fibrous tissue or\nadditional lesions. No lymph nodes are present on the lateral aspect of the\nspecimen.   Cassette: A1   skin lesions, A2   skin scars, A3-A6   entire\npossible lesion, A7-A10   representative sections of remaining specimen,\nincluding margins.\n                       Formalin fixation time: 9-11 hours.\nB.   Container designation: \"axillary tissue left side\" --  Received fresh\nfor intraoperative consultation is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm portion of yellow\nlobulated adipose tissue.  The specimen is sectioned to reveal no discrete\nlymph nodes.  Cassettes: entirely submitted in B1-B3.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS   AXILLARY TISSUE: NO GROSS TUMOR OR\nLYMPH NODE (XX)\nC.   Container designation: \"right breast\" --  Received fresh for\nintraoperative consultation is a 528.5 gram, 22 x 17 x 3 cm simple\nmastectomy specimen, partially surfaced with a 7.5 x 4.9 cm central nipple\nbearing skin ellipse. The breast has a clip on one end designated \"clip in\naxilla\" per the requisition slip. The skin has a scar surrounding the\nareola and a 0.3 cm dark brown flat lesion at the 3:00 edge.  A 0.7 x 0.3 x\n0.2 cm calcified focus is present at approximately 6:30, 2 cm from the\nnipple and 1 cm from all margins.  The remaining specimen contains about\n40% thickened cystic multinodular fibrous stroma.  No discrete lesions are\ngrossly identified.  No lymph nodes are present on the lateral aspect of\nthe specimen.  Cassettes: C1   nipple and skin including lesion and scar,\nC2-C3   upper outer quadrant, including anterior margin at 10:00, 2 cm from\nthe skin edge, C4-C5   lower outer quadrant, including fibrous tissue and\nanterior margin at approximately 6:30, 1 cm from skin edge, C6-C7   lower\ninner quadrant including anterior margin at approximately 3:30, 2.5 cm from\nskin edge, C8-C9   upper inner quadrant including anterior margin at\napproximately 2:30, 2.5 cm from skin edge, and C10   calcified focus, after\ndecalcification.\n      Formalin fixation time: 8.5   10.5 hours.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS   RIGHT BREAST: MARGINS GROSSLY\nNEGATIVE (XX)\nD.   Container designation: \"right axillary contents\" --  Received fresh\nfor intraoperative cytology are two lymph nodes, 0.7 and 1.3 cm.  The\nsmaller node is uninked and bisected, the larger node is inked blue and\nbisected longitudinally.  Scrape preps are performed.  Cassettes: D1\nsmaller lymph node, D2   larger lymph node.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY DIAGNOSIS   R AXILLARY NODE: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR\n(XX)\nE.   Container designation: \"Additional right axillary contents\" --  The\nspecimen consists of a 7.0 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of fat containing three\npossible lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm.

MALIGNANT PHYLLODES TUMOR\n  2.  TUMOR FOCALLY WITHIN 1 MM OF THE INFERIOR MARGIN\n\nBreast Tumor Information:\nType of specimen(s):  Lumpectomy, right breast\nHistologic Type:  Phyllodes tumor, Malignant\nSize:    7.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm\nMitotic rate:  Up to 11 per 10 hpfs\nCellularity:  High\nResection margins:  Negative; Within 1 mm focally (inferior margin)\nOther findings:  Stomal overgrow present\n    Satellite nodule present.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThis case was reviewed in consultation by pathologists at UCSF (see ***PATH-NUMBER[1]).  The following paragraphs are taken from the comments in the consultation report:\n\n\"Based on the gross description and the microscopic sections, the right lumpectomy shows two apparent masses that are juxtaposed to each other with abrupt transition in morphologic features (best demonstrated on slide 11).  The larger mass is composed of proliferation of highly cellular spindle cells growing in interweaving fascicles with no obvious epithelial differentiation.  Rare elongated benign tubules are noted within the periphery of the spindle cell mass.  the spindle cells have pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders.  The nuclei show a vesicular chromatin pattern with inconspicuous nucleoli.  Mitotic activity varies regionally, but overall is moderate to high, and measures up to 11 mitotic figures/10hpfs.  No necrosis is identified.  No heterologous elements (such as lipogenic or chondroid differentiation) are identified in the slides available for review.  Although the mass has an overall well-circumscribed contour, irregular large tongues of growth and microscopic infiltration into adjacent fat are noted, and a small satellite nodule is seen on slide 26.  \n\nThe smaller nodule shows a fibroepithelial lesion that in some areas with paucicellular stroma is reminiscent of a fibroadenoma, but in other areas displaying increased stromal cellularity and mitotic activity (I found 2 mitotic figures in one high power field on slide 8) beyond what would be seen in fibroadenomas and would place this nodule into the category of phyllodes tumor.\n\nBased on the presence of a phyllodes tumor in the smaller nodule and the juxtaposition of the two nodules, the differential diagnosis for the larger mass with cellular spindle cells would most likely be part of the phyllodes tumor as the result of stromal overgrowth.  Other consideration includes metaplastic carcinoma or less likely other mesenchymal tumors. \n\nThe following stains were performed and interpreted at HMC: CD34 patchy positivity, SMA positive, S-100 negative , Desmin negative, LCA negative, Oscar/keratin negative.  The following stains were performed at UCSF: keratin MNF1 negative, p63 negative.  \n\nNegative staining for epithelial markers and p63 helps exclude the possibility of a metaplastic breast carcinoma.  Negative S100 and desmin argues against melanoma and leiomyosarcoma respectively.  The histologic features are not those of  an angiosarcoma.  Patchy positivity for CD34 can be seen in the stromal component of phyllodes tumors.  Furthermore, the presence of rare elongated benign tubules within the large mass also supports this as phyllodes tumor.\n\nThis phyllodes tumor is further categorized as malignant based on stromal overgrowth with highly cellular stroma, high mitotic activity, and irregular infiltrative border.  \n\nBased on slides available for review, margins are negative but close (<1mm to yellow inked inferior margin) and at least one satellite nodule is noted.  Ideally, treatment for malignant phyllodes tumors should include widely clear margins (1 cm if possible).  Therefore, close follow-up is recommended for recurrence, and re-excision may merit consideration.\"  \n\nPreliminary findings called to the office of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[May 29 12].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right breast lumpectomy\" is a lumpectomy specimen consisting of a strip of tan skin (7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) with attached rubbery tan-yellow tissue (8.5 x 8.5 x 6 cm).  Metal tags mark the cranial/superior margin, caudal/inferior margin, medial margin and lateral margin.  The specimen is differentially inked as follows: superior-blue ink, inferior-yellow ink, anterior-black ink, posterior-green ink, medial and lateral-red ink.  \n\nThe specimen is serially sectioned into fourteen lamellae from medial (lamella 1) to lateral (lamella 14) direction.  A large circumscribed, soft to rubbery pink-tan mass (7.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm) has a uniform cut surface and is found within lamellae 1 through 13.  The mass grossly approaches to within 1.5 cm of the superior margin, 0.1 cm of the inferior margin, 0.1 cm of the anterior margin, 0.2 cm of the posterior margin, 0.4 cm of the medial margin and 0.6 cm of the lateral margin.  \n\nAlso found in lamellae 4 through 10 is a well-circumscribed rubbery firm and fibrous white nodule (4.2 x 3 x 2.5 cm) which is found adjacent and superior to the previously described mass.  A biopsy clip is found in lamella 8 within the fibrous nodule.  Remainder of the specimen consists of fibrofatty tissue.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock Summary:\n1.  -  Lamella 1, representative perpendicular sections of medial margin, mass.\n2.  -  Lamella 2, anterior section, mass.\n3.  -  Lamella 3, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n4.  -  Lamella 4, superior and anterior section, fibrous nodule.\n5.  -  Lamella 4, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n6.  -  Lamella 5, anterior section, fibrous nodule and mass.\n7.  -  Lamella 5, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n8.  -  Lamella 6, superior and anterior section, fibrous nodule.\n9.  -  Lamella 6, anterior section, fibrous nodule and mass.\n10.  -  Lamella 7, superior and anterior section, fibrous nodule.\n11.  -  Lamella 7, anterior section, fibrous nodule and mass.\n12.  -  Lamella 7, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n13.  -  Lamella 8, superior and anterior section, fibrous nodule.\n14.  -  Lamella 8, anterior section, fibrous nodule and mass, location of biopsy clip.\n15.  -  Lamella 8, anterior section, fibrous nodule and mass.\n16.  -  Lamella 8, posterior section, fibrous nodule and mass.\n17.  -  Lamella 8, skin and anterior section, mass.\n18.  -  Lamella 8, inferior section, mass.\n19.  -  Lamella 9, superior and anterior section, fibrous nodule.\n20.  -  Lamella 9, superior and posterior section, fibrous nodule.\n21.  -  Lamella 9, inferior and posterior section, mass.\n22.  -  Lamella 10, superior and anterior section, fibrous nodule.\n23.  -  Lamella 10, inferior and posterior section, mass.\n24.  -  Lamella 11, superior and posterior section.\n25.  -  Lamella 11, skin and anterior section, mass.\n26.  -  Lamella 11, posterior section, mass.\n27.  -  Lamella 12, anterior and posterior section, mass.\n28.  -  Lamella 12, posterior section, mass.\n29.  -  Lamella 12, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n30.  -  Lamella 13, posterior section, mass.\n31-32.  -  Lamella 14, representative perpendicular sections of lateral margin.\n\nThe specimen was received in formalin on **DATE[May 21 12] at 15:15 hours, for a total fixation time of approximately 29.5 hours.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right breast lumpectomy\n"

Container designation: \"left breast mastectomy\" --  The specimen\nconsists of an oriented (short superior, long lateral), 140 gram, 15.0 x\n12.5 x 2.5 cm simple left mastectomy.  The mastectomy is surfaced by a 16.5\nx 5.0 cm blue-dyed nipple bearing skin ellipse. The nipple has superficial\nsloughing skin but is not retraced.  Also received separate unattached is a\n4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm additional portion of fatty soft tissue. The mastectomy\ndeep margin is inked black, the anterior margin is inked blue and the most\nlateral skin edge is overlaid with red ink.  There is a 2.6 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm\nirregular bordered fibrotic area at 2 o'clock, 3.0 cm from the nipple.  The\nfibrotic area is 1.5 cm or greater from the inked margins.  The fibrotic\narea contains a hemorrhagic biopsy site containing an intraparenchymal\nmetallic marking clip.  There are no other fibrotic areas or mass lesions\nidentified.  The remainder of the specimen is predominantly fat admixed\nwith a minimal amount of fibrous tissue (15%).  There are no lesions\nunderlying the nipple and no lymph nodes identified at the lateral aspect\nof the specimen.  The separately received portion of unoriented fatty soft\ntissue is inked green.  The cut surfaces are vascular with no lymph nodes\nor mass lesions identified.

The accompanying report is also received.\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  The slides are from the right middle lobe biopsies per the accompanied report and consist of several fragments of bronchial mucosa as well as portion of alveolated lung parenchyma.  Both the bronchial mucosa and the alveolated lung parenchyma show several groups of malignant cells with features consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma present in lymphatic vessels.  The tumor cells have large pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic, slightly vacuolated cytoplasm.  The immunoperoxidase stains which are received show the tumor cells to be strongly positive for CK7 and negative for CK20, CDX2, P63 and TTF1.  The morphologic features, in conjunction with this immunophenotype, are consistent with a non small cell carcinoma with features favoring an adenocarcinoma and although a primary lung adenocarcinoma cannot be ruled out, other sites should also be considered.  Clinical and imaging correlation is recommended.\n1: Outside slide consult charge\n"

Mucin production is present, but is not a prominent feature.  The ovarian serous carcinoma is also growing in a glandular pattern, but it lacks the slit-like spaces of the endometrial tumor, and shows much more mucin production.  In addition, no involvement of the ovarian surface, bilateral parametria, or uterine serosa was observed.  These features would favor two synchronous primaries.  However, the ovarian tumor has a cystic background and consists entirely of intraepithelial carcinoma, with no lower-grade \\\"borderline\\\" areas observed.  This is distinctly unusual, and a metastasis cannot be excluded.  If the ovarian tumor represents a metastasis from the endometrium, the endometrial stage would be pT3a.  Clinical correlation is suggested.      P53 immunohistochemical stains were performed on both the ovarian and endometrial tumors and were both positive, confirming serous subtype.  Given the mucin production of the ovarian tumor, a CK20 immunohistochemical stain was also performed to exclude a colonic metastasis, and was negative.  This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference.

Received in formalin is a 31 in length x 9.5 cm. in circumference portion of unopened colon with one end closed with staples.  The serosal surface is tan-pink and is focally hemorrhagic near the opened end.  There is a moderate amount of attached fat that measures up to 9.5 cm. in length. There is a small attached sheath of omentum that measures 9.3 cm. in length and up to 13 cm. in diameter.  Opening shows a moderate amount of brown to green thickened fecal material.  There are mostly irregular tan to pink mucosal folds with multiple scattered diverticula.  Located 10.5 cm. away from the stapled end there is a narrowed area that shows a somewhat thickened, pink to hemorrhagic possible mass measuring 1.8 x 2.2 cm.  This mass is located 21.2 cm. away from the opposite opened end and less than 2 cm. away from the radial margin.  Located 3.2 cm. away from the opened end there is a slightly raised tan nodule measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  It is entirely submitted.  The serosal surface at the area of the mass is inked black and the radial margin is inked green.  This mass is entirely submitted.  Sectioning through the attached fat shows fifteen tan to pink possible lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 up to 0.6 cm.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: \"1\" - stapled end; \"2\" - opposite opened end; \"3\" - diverticula; \"4\" - irregular mucosa; \"5\" - nodule near the opened end; \"6-7\" - radial margin; \"8-13\" - mass; \"14\" - three possible nodes; \"15\" - six possible nodes; \"16\" - six possible nodes; \"17\" - omentum./AKC,MRJ\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen consists of a section of colon showing invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma composed of irregular glands lined by columnar epithelium with elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. The tumor exhibits large areas of mucin lakes. The tumor appears to be arising from a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. The tumor invades into the the pericolonic fat and present focally on the serosal surface. Immunohistochemical stain (AE1/3) with appropriately working controls was performed on the specimen (A9) for qualitative impression and it highlight the tumor on the serosal surface. Althought the area where the tumor is present on the serosa does not show rupture, an adjacent area shows extravasated mucin protruding outside the serosal surface through a ruptured area. No lymphvascular invasion is identified.  Resection margins, as well as the radial margin, are negative for carcinoma.  Sections from the omentum reveal no evidence of invasive carcinoma.  There are fifteen lymph nodes identified with no evidence of invasive carcinoma.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:   COLECTOMY, PARTIAL, TRANSVERSE AND SPLENIC FLEXURE\n"

The great vessels of the venous return are in the usual position and unremarkable.\n\nRespiratory System:  The larynx, trachea and bronchi show no abnormalities.  A small amount of blood is present in the right main bronchus and the smaller bronchi on the right side.  The right and left lungs weigh 680 and 890 grams respectively.  The pleural surfaces exhibit scattered anthracosis.  There is a large irregularly nodular mass occupying the apical portion of the right upper lobe which is adherent to the chest wall.  Sectioning reveals areas of necrosis, black pigmentation and small areas of bleeding.  The entire upper lobe is replaced by this mass.  There are small yellow-white firm nodules on the surface of the lower lobe of the left lung.  Sectioning through the lungs reveal a large amount of blood tinged fluid exuding through the cut surfaces.  There is bilateral acute congestion and severe bilateral anthracosis.  The pulmonary vessels occupy the usual relationships without evidence of emboli.  \n\nHepatobiliary System:  The liver weighs 1250 grams and has a smooth, glistening surface.  Cut surfaces show deep red parenchyma. \n\nLymphoreticular System:  The spleen weighs 160 grams and has a smooth, glistening capsule and an unremarkable parenchyma. The hilar lymph nodes show enlargement predominantly on the right side with black discoloration.\n\nUrinary System:  The right and left kidneys weigh 110 grams each.

Please correlate clinically and with the radiographic findings. |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived fresh labeled \"XXXXXX\" are approximately seven cores of tan-white tissue measuring up to 1.0 cm in length and <0.1 cm in diameter.  Air-dried, Diff-Quik stain imprints are prepared for intraoperative consultation.  A portion of the specimen is saved for possible cultures.  The remaining tissue is placed in formalin, and submitted in toto for light microscopy evaluation in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained sections demonstrates thin cores of lung parenchyma infiltrated by numerous tumor cells found singly or in nests.  The tumor cells are variable in size and shape and generally have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cytoplasmic boarders and hyperchromatic large nuclei.  A few associated mitotic figures are seen.  The tumor lacks a glanular pattern and no intercellular bridges are seen.  The tumor cells are found in association with acute inflammation and background fibrosis.  No granulomas or necrosis is seen.  Focal benign cartilage and focal benign respiratory mucosa are present.  The Diff-Quik touch prep stains demonstrate numerous large abnormal cells with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In the background, there are numerous macrophages, neutrophils and fewer small lymphocytes.  Immunohistochemical stains were conducted.  The tumor labels with cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 (focal), p63 (rare), cytokeratin 5/6 (rare, weak), and TTF-1.  The tumor does not label with CDX2 or PSA (positive controls intact). \n\nNOTES:  Dr. **NAME[XXX] has reviewed this case and concurs with the diagnosis.  Results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[M.

There is an abundant amount of attached tan/yellow lobular mesenteric fat. The appendix is not present. The colon is opened to reveal a 0.5 cm in greatest dimension mucosa defect surrounded by black ink. This area is consistent with the previous polypectomy site. This area is 12.5 cm from the proximal resection margin and 15 cm from the distal resection margin. No polyp or invasive tumor is identified grossly in this area. There is a second area of submucosal ink 3 cm from the polypectomy site. No invasive tumor is identified in this area. The second area is greater than 10 cm from both the proximal and distal resection margins. Both of the areas are greater than 5 cm from the radial/mesenteric resection margin. There is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm flattened centrally ulcerated mass identified 2 cm from the two previously described polypectomy site. This area is consistent with an area of invasive tumor and is located 7 cm from the proximal resection margin and greater than 15 cm from the distal resection margin. No invasion into the underlying fat is identified and the area is greater than 5 cm from the radial resection margin. The remaining mucosa is tan and glistening with normal folds. No other masses or suspicious lesions are appreciated. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: A  proximal resection margin taken en face; B  distal resection margin taken en face; C  radial resection margin; D-E  invasive tumor; F-H  polypectomy sites; I-J  intact lymph nodes.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The mucosal and radial margins are free of tumor.  The lesion in blocks D and E shows an invasive adenocarcinoma which extends into the submucosa only.  No deep invasion is seen.  Sections from the additional biopsy sites show some pigment within the submucosal stroma with some reactive changes but no adenomatous change or invasive tumor is seen.  Thirteen lymph nodes are identified and none of these show metastasis.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. Procedures/Addenda\n"

Specimen is totally embedded in one cassette. GAR\nMicroscopic Description Multiple sections of the right breast needle core biopsy show fibrotic pressed tissue with extensive malignant cell population displaying a glandular and focal solid growth pattern with moderate nuclear pleomorphism exhibited by oval nuclei with pseudonuclear inclusions, minimal cytoplasm, and no mitotic figures.  Occasional nests of ductal cells displaying a cellular proliferation with focal myoepithelial cells are noted somewhat suggestive of at least atypical ductal hyperplasia. Immunoperoxidase stains are performed with appropriate controls and the results are as follows: 1.  Actin:   Negative for a myoepithelial cell layer with extensive positivity for fibroblast 2.  CD34:   Positive for occasional myoepithelial cells and blood vessels without evidence of lymphovascular invasion 3.   Estrogen receptor:  Strongly positive 4.   KCAM:  Strongly diffusely positive 5.   Progesterone receptor:  Moderate to strongly positive The overall staining pattern confirms the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma.  No microcalcifications or lymphovascular invasion is seen.\nSpecimen Source:   \\S\\core biopsy, right breast x 4\\S\\\\S\\0  \n"

All internal and external controls were appropriately reactive.\nThe steroid receptor result is positive if at least 1% of tumor cell nuclei\nshow specific staining. For positive cases the \"fraction of cells staining\"\nis a visual estimate subject to observer variation. For Her2, membrane\npositivity was scored according to **NAME[ZZZ] ASCP/CAP consensus (J Clin Oncol\n25:188, 2007):  0-1+ is negative for overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and\n3+ is positive.\n\nCOMMENT:  This case has been amended to modify the her-2 results above.  No\nother changes were made. Complete membrane staining is seen in over 30% of\ntumor cells, however, the staining intensity is moderate to focally strong\nand a 2+ score is most appropriate followed up her-2 FISH testing.\nThe infiltrating carcinoma demonstrates only a focal tubular formation and\nabundant single cell infiltrating pattern.  Immunohistochemical studies,\nusing appropriately reactive controls, demonstrate strong staining of the\ntumor with e-cadherin consistent with a ductal origin.\n\nREVIEWED BY:  Dr. **NAME[M.

Though the largest studies have used 10% as a \n  threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%. \n\nHER-2/neu\n  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-\n  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu \n  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.\n\n  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and \n  equivocal) were appropriate.\n\n  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following \n  manner, as determined by in-house studies:\n\n  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP \n  Result:          Score:\n\n  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)\n\n  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)\n\n  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in \n                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the \n                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of invasive \n                       tumor cells)\n\n  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% \n                       invasive tumor cells)\n\n  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise \n  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[Jan 2003], **PLACE, \n  IL).\n\n  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American \n  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered \n  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than \n  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.  \n  \nReferences:\n  1.

The clinical and histologic features are best in keeping with prostatic duct adenocarcinoma with a focal cribriform, Grade 4 pattern in addition to an apparent more exophytic papillary pattern.  Prostatic duct adenocarcinomas may more often have a course approximating a Gleason grade 4+4, sum 8 form of the much more common prostatic adenocarcinoma of prostatic acinar derivation.

Other parts of the tumor have a focal cribriform back to back gland arrangement with glandular confluence and invasive features with general absence of immunoreactive cells for high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63 with only rare areas with some background non-neoplastic prostatic glands with some immunoreactive cells.  The lesion diffusely expresses prostatic specific antigen and in most areas expresses p504 (AMCAR) consistent with a prostate derived lesion.\n\nProstate Cancer Information\nBased on AJCC/UICC TNM, 7th edition\n\nProcedure:  Transurethral prostatic resection \nSpecimen size:  Weight:  1.6 g\nHistologic type:  Prostatic duct adenocarcinoma \nHistologic grade\n    Total Gleason score:  4+4, sum 8\nTumor quantitation:  Proportion (percentage) of prostatic tissue involved by tumor:  Approximately 96%./r/n\nA: PROSTATIC URETHRAL LESION, excision\n"

The specimen has been fixed in formalin for greater than 6 hours and less than 48 hours. The specimen consists of a modified radical mastectomy specimen which includes a skin ellipse measuring 23.4 x 10.7 x 0.2 cm. Centrally located is a nipple and areola measuring 3.7 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm. The skin surface is light tan and smooth with one brown macule measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The edges are regular and extend to within 2.1 cm of the inferior surgical margin. Underlying the skin ellipse is fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 22.5 x 18.9 x 5.2 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing yellow adipose tissue with grey-white breast tissue marbling through it. An ill-defined gray-white mass lesion is present located centrally in the breast measuring 1.1 x 1 x 0.7 cm. The mass lesion is associated with a metal marking pellet and extends to within 1.6 cm of the posterior inked surgical margin. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal no additional mass lesions or areas of hemorrhage. Attached to the breast is an axillary tail measuring 8 x 7.7 x 2 cm. Sections through the adipose tissue reveal several dark tan to pale tan lymph nodes ranging up to 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. Lymph nodes are dissected away from the adipose tissue and submitted. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette A: Nipple, cassette B: Skin, cassette C: Mass lesion located closest to posterior inked surgical margin, cassettes D - F: Mass lesion, cassette G: Upper inner quadrant, cassette H: Lower inner quadrant, cassette I: Upper outer quadrant, cassette J: Lower outer quadrant, cassette K: 2 lymph nodes, cassette L: 2 lymph nodes, cassette M: 4 lymph nodes, cassette N: 2 lymph nodes, cassette O: 2 lymph nodes, cassette P: 3 lymph nodes, cassette Q: 2 lymph nodes, cassette R: 2 lymph nodes, cassette S: One lymph node. **DATE[Jun 19 2012] SMC/AO\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nleft breast cancer\n1).

Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in a tubulovillous adenoma.   B.     Lesion extends to within 0.9 cm of polyp base.  C.     Negative for evidence of definitive stalk invasion.   D.     Base of polyp negative for evidence of dysplasia.   E.     Separate foci of at least high grade glandular dysplasia in a separately grossly described tubulovillous adenoma, base of polyp negative for evidence of dysplasia. Comment:    It is not clear whether the lesions represent two separate polyps at the same location or one single fragmented polyp.  No area of carcinoma or high grade dysplasia in either polyp is closer than 0.9 cm from the respective bases of excision.  Clinical correlation is suggested.                       1 Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[XXX M. WWW], M.D.\nGross Description Specimen #1 is received in formalin and labeled with the patient name and \"colon polyp 45 cm\". The specimen consists of two red-tan pediculated polyps. The first polyp measures 2.4 x 2 x 1.8 cm.  The polyp sets on a stalk measuring 1 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter. The surface of the polyp is red-pink, lobular and friable. The resection margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals a villous appearance and is markedly friable. The second polyp measures 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The polyp sets on a stalk measuring 0.4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The resection margin is inked blue.  The external surface of the polyp is red-tan and slightly granular. The cut surface is red-pink, slightly hemorrhagic and solid. A small amount of mucin material is identified.  The first described polyp is totally submitted in (blocks A-D). The second polyp is totally submitted in (blocks E-F). **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Microscopic examination reveals sections of polypoid colonic lesions demonstrating a focal villiform architecture and pseudostratified columnar lining epithelium with elongated hyperchromatic nuclei.  Multiple foci of the smaller grossly described polyp demonstrate cribriform gland formation with rounded atypical nuclei with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios also noted.  The atypical nuclei demonstrate coarse chromatin and occasional nucleoli.  Definitive stalk invasion is not identified.  The lesion extends to within 0.9 cm of the polyp base and no evidence of obvious dysplasia is noted at the polyp excision base.  The larger grossly described polyp also demonstrates foci of at least high grade glandular dysplasia which do not demonstrate evidence of stalk invasion.  The base of the larger polyp is also negative for dysplasia. CBG/js\n"

COMMENT:  This report was faxed to the Radiologist at the Breast Imaging Services on **DATE[May 16 12].  **INITIALS\nGross Description The specimen, labeled left breast stereotactic biopsy, received in formalin, consists of two cassettes one of which is designated with a Steri-Strip. The undesignated cassette contains a 2.5x2.5x0.3 cm aggregate of tan/pink fibroadipose breast tissue fragments which were placed in formalin at 11:45 am and are now submitted in cassette A. The taped, designated cassette contains a 2.5x2.3x0.3 cm aggregate of tan/pink fibroadipose breast tissue fragments which were placed in formalin at 11:45 am and are now submitted in cassette B.     HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the left breast show fibrous and adipose tissue with essentially unremarkable lobular units; however, the ducts show modest dilatation in several with a micropapillary apocrine appearing hyperplasia. These ducts occasional show small foci of central necrosis in the ducts containing the micropapillary atypical hyperplastic change. The biopsy also shows focal dystrophic calcification within these ducts.  NOTE: The ductal changes are suspicious for a micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ; the case will be forwarded to Dr. **NAME[UUU] Page and his colleagues for review.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Amended:  **DATE[May 21 2012] by **NAME[TTT SSS RRR] Reason: OUTSIDE CONSULTATION RESULTS      Dr. **NAME[XXX M.

We agree that there is extensive ductal carcinoma in\n  situ with a focal area suspicious for invasion but also agree that because\n  this area is within the biopsy needle tract, that it brings up the possibility\n  of pseudo-invasion/entrapped epithelium. The received calponin and p63\n  immunostains show a lack of myoepithelial cells, which is consistent with\n  either displaced epithelium or invasion. After review by Drs **NAME[ZZZ, YYY]\n  and **NAME[XXX], we all agree that because these atypical glands are not present\n  outside of the biopsy tract, that they most likely represent displaced\n  epithelium and not invasive carcinoma.\n  Procedures used to establish the diagnosis:\n  RoutineMATERIALS RECEIVED:\n  Label Consult Accession No Blocks/Slides Description\n   A ***PATH-NUMBER[1]  0B,7S  Right breast\n"

A localization wire with hook tip is embedded within the specimen.  Sutures are present designated as follows:  long = lateral, short = superior, double = deep.  The anterior edge contains a sliver of tan skin 3.5 cm in length and 0.1 to 0.2 cm in width.  The specimen is somewhat flattened in the medial to lateral aspect.  No skeletal muscle is identified at the designated deep margin.  The lateral aspect is marked with black ink with the medial aspect with blue ink with the remaining margins identified by the confluence of inks.  Sectioning reveals an eccentrically located 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm somewhat stellate mass with central hemorrhage consistent with prior biopsy site.  Tumor extends to within approximately 0.2 cm of the closest lateral margin and approximately 0.8 cm of the closest medial margin.  The remaining margins are more widely clear.  The remainder of the breast demonstrates lobulated yellow fatty tissue with minimal fibrosis.  No additional suspicious areas are seen.

One margin is closed with metal sutures and the opposite margin is unsutured.  There is a white silk suture adjacent to the sutured margin indicating the sutured margin to be proximal.  8.5 cm from the proximal margin of resection there is a 7.5 x 5.8 x 2.8 cm circumferential partially polypoid neoplastic appearing lesion which involves the full thickness of the bowel wall and focally infiltrates into the adjacent pericolonic soft tissues.  The serosa is hyperemic but remains smooth.  The lesion is 8 cm from the ligated and grossly uninvolved mesenteric apex margin.  Proximal to the lesion the bowel shows a few diverticula.  Distal to the lesion the bowel shows no focal lesions.  No polyps or other masses are identified.  The proximal and distal margins are grossly uninvolved.  The attached fat is found to contain multiple grossly benign appearing lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.  Detachable within the same container is a 5.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm strip of soft tissue containing numerous metal sutures and a 2.1 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm irregular piece of yellow and tan tissue.  The origin of these is unclear.

DGD/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 labeled left breast tissue, received in formalin, consists of a 471 gram, 18.0x16.0x4.0 cm intact simple mastectomy specimen. The specimen is partially surfaced by a 5.5x3.8 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1.4 cm in diameter. The deep margin is inked black and sectioning reveals approximately equal proportions of yellow adipose tissue and dense white fibrocystic breast tissue. No masses, suspicious lesions or previous biopsy sites are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 1A-1I  representative sections of fibrocystic breast tissue; 1J  representative section of nipple.  Specimen 2 labeled #1 sentinel node and #2 sentinel node, received fresh for frozen section, consists of two tan/pink lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension which are submitted entirely for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette 2.  Specimen 3 labeled right breast tissue, received in formalin, consists of a 422.2 gram intact simple mastectomy specimen with overall dimensions of 18.0x15.0x4.0 cm. The specimen is partially surfaced by a 6.0x3.5 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1.4 cm in diameter. There is a suture designating the superior aspect. The margins are inked as follows: superficial margin blue, deep margin black, and sectioning reveals a 0.8x0.8x0.7 cm tan/pink biopsy cavity, 1.5 cm from the deep margin and 1.7 cm from the superficial margin. Located 3.3 cm lateral from this site is a 1.1x0.8x0.8 cm tan biopsy site containing a metal clip. The more lateral biopsy site is 0.8 cm from the deep margin and 1.9 cm from the superficial margin. The tissue between the two biopsy sites is tan/pink and fibrocystic. The two biopsy sites are located in the upper central to outer quadrant. Sectioning through the remaining breast tissue reveals dense white fibrocystic breast tissue. No other definitive masses or biopsy sites are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 3A-3D  central upper quadrant biopsy cavity submitted in its entirety to include deep and superficial margins; 3E-3F  breast tissue between the two biopsy sites; 3G-3H  second more lateral biopsy site to include deep and superficial margin; 3I  large cyst/suspicious area directly adjacent second more lateral biopsy site; 3J-3K  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue from the upper inner quadrant located approximately 3  3.5 cm from the first more central biopsy cavity; 3L-3M  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue from the central aspect of the breast located approximately 1.5  2 cm from the more central biopsy cavity; 3N-3O  representative sections of breast tissue from the lower inner quadrant approximately 4.5  5 cm from the first more central biopsy cavity; 3P-3Q  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue from the lower outer quadrant approximately 5 cm from the biopsy cavity; 3R  representative section of nipple.  HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Multiple representative sections of the breast show numerous dilated ducts, scattered benign lobular units and focal microcalcifications. The ducts show no epithelial proliferation and occasional ducts show apocrine metaplastic change. One of the ducts shows a small sclerotic intraductal papilloma. Sections of the skin of nipple are remarkable for benign squamous epithelium without atypia and no evidence of lymphvascular infiltration in the dermal lymphatics. There is a small fibroadenoma less than 1 mm in size in block 1I.  Sections of the two lymph nodes show mildly reactive nodes with a modest degree of sinus histiocytosis. There is no evidence of granulomatous inflammation or metastatic tumor. Sections of the right breast show a single small focus of residual intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. The tumor shows a focus where duct epithelium is overfilling the ducts and the nuclear features of the epithelium are relatively pleomorphic with prominent macronucleoli compatible with DCIS. Numerous calcifications are seen within the affected ducts. Also noted in the background breast tissue are large areas of proliferative fibrocystic change and some of the dilated ducts show apocrine metaplastic alterations. No lymphvascular invasion is identified.  DGD/mbc\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By DARON **PLACE Procedures/Addenda\n"

RIGHT THYROID LOBE: Two lesions: Papillary microcarcinoma, see note #1. - Tumor size:  0.90 mm. - Extent of invasion:  Tumor appears confined to the thyroid. - Angiolymphatic invasion:  Not identified. - Margins:  Clear. Follicular adenoma, see note #2. - Tumor size:  2.8 cm. - Capsular invasion:  Not identified. - Vascular invasion:  Not identified. B.  SKIN OF LEFT NOSE, EXCISION: Mildly acanthotic squamous epithelium, see note #3. Mild chronic inflammation. Note #1:  In additional tissue submitted for permanent sections there is a single, very small focus of papillary microcarcinoma that is centrally located and represents an incidental finding.  In the planes of section, this focus confined to the thyroid and is approximately 4 mm from the margin of resection. Note #2:  The entire primary lesion was submitted for histologic examination.  It is thinly encapsulated and consists of thyroid follicular epithelial cells arranged into small microfollicles containing a small amount of luminal colloid.  Unequivocal light microscopic evidence for malignancy (capsular/vascular invasion) are not appreciated in the planes of section. Note #3:  Confirmatory immunohistochemical stains are pending.\nGROSS: A.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name. It is additionally labeled right thyroid lobe with mass. It consists of a 4.4 x \\R\\4.0 cm thyroid lobectomy specimen remarkable for an \\R\\2.4 cm well circumscribed lesion. The resection margin is entirely inked black. The specimen is sectioned revealing a well circumscribed thinly encapsulated \\R\\2.2 cm tan colored lesion. A portion is submitted for a frozen section and smear. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DX: Follicular lesion, defer to permanent sections.      (CJM) The residual tissue from frozen section is submitted into Cassette A1. The entire lesion is subsequently submitted into Cassettes A2-A5, and unremarkable thyroid parenchyma in A6. B.  Received designated left nasal lesion is a 1 mm fragment of pink and tan tissue which is entirely submitted as B1.               (AEE)\nMICROSCOPIC: A microscopic examination has been performed. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT Using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue with the appropriate positive and negative controls, the specimen designated skin of left nose (block B1) is stained for immunoreactive epithelial membrane antigen, S100, CD-34 using an automated immunohistochemical technique. All internal and external controls react appropriately. INTERPRETATION:  Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for the epithelial membrane antigen stain is noted in unremarkable epithelium only.  The S100 stain is negative in the planes of interest.  The CD-34 stain shows cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in benign endothelial cells.  Overall, there is no light microscopic/immunohistochemical evidence for neoplasm. These findings support the final diagnosis. Preliminary Diagnosis performed by **NAME[M. ZZZ YYY], M.D. Electronically signed **DATE[Aug 4 2012] 12:24PM Final Diagnosis performed by **NAME[M. ZZZ YYY], M.D. Electronically signed **DATE[Aug 7 2012] 1:52PM\nSPECIMEN:  A.

Received fresh for frozen section designated \"right sentinel node\" is an irregular fragment of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm.  Blue discoloration is noted within the adipose tissue.  Sectioning and palpation of the specimen reveals a single fragmented lymph node candidate measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  A touch prep is prepared and the specimen is entirely submitted on a single block for frozen section.  Following frozen section, the specimen is submitted in cassette A-FSC.  Sentinel lymph node protocol is observed.  B.  Received in formalin designated \"right breast cancer\" is an ovoid fragment of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 1.8 cm.  The specimen exhibits blue discoloration associated with injection dye.  The specimen is received without orientation.  The specimen is marked with black ink and serially sectioned from end to end to reveal an   ill-defined area of pink-tan firm tumor measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm.  Tumor abuts multiple inked surfaces.  Multiple representative sections from the specimen are sequentially submitted as follows:  B1\\T\\B2.        representative sections immediately adjacent to area of tumor B3-B5.        entire area of tumor submitted by full cross section B6\\T\\B7.        representative sections immediately adjacent to area of tumor B8.        full cross sections representing each end of the specimen  The specimen is removed from the patient at 11:08 a.m. and placed into formalin at 11:12 a.m.  The specimen is received in pathology at 11:48 a.m. and sectioned and placed into formalin at 12:07 p.m. on **DATE[Jun 16 12].  **INITIALS \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Microscopic examination is performed.

The  H\\T\\E-stained sections demonstrate sclerotic tissue with infiltrating malignant tumor cells, rarely forming vague glandular configurations.  Immunohistochemical stains are performed; all controls react appropriately.  The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, TTF-1, and p63 (focally), and they are negative for cytokeratin 20 and cytokeratin 5/6.  The morphologic features and immunophenotypic findings are those of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary.  \n\nThe findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Dec 16 11] at 4:36 p.m./r/n\nGrossDescription:\nLabeled:      patient name and medical record number, designated lung biopsy\nSpecimen:    cylindrical (formalin)\nNumber:      two\nSize:           up to 1.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm \nSubmitted/Block:    entirely/1./r/n\nMicroscopicDescription:\nMicroscopic evaluation was performed.

The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggests that the patient may not respond to ALK \n    inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested. \n\n    Reference range:\n    Not Detected:  Less than or equal to 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 45  ALK signals apart by greater \n    than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n    Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 45  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times \n    signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n\n    Methodology:\n    After determining the tumor area on the H\\T\\E slide form this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient \n    specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LIS ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay \n    (Abbot Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe \n    (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non-overlapping \n    nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals \n    were recorded and interpreted.\n\n    Intended Use:\n    The LSI ALK (anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbot Molecular) is \n    designed to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-\n    associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4-ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  \n    EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung adenocarcinoma.  Patients who harbor this mutation may respond \n    to ALK inhibitors.  Nature 448, 561-566 (2 **DATE[May 2008]).  Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion \n    gene in the non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n    Prognostic and predictive testing should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical and/or \n    histopathological findings.\n\n    Some tests use Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR s).  The performance characteristics of these ASR s were \n    determined by Clarient.  They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n    (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  Clarient is certified under the \n    Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to performing high complexity \n    clinical laboratory testing./r/n\nThe following results were performed at Clarient Diagnostic Services, Aliso Viejo, CA and reported by **NAME[XXX WWW], M.D. on **DATE[Jan 29 2012].   \n\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\n\nExon 19 deletionIncreased responsiveness to TKIsDeletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1).G719S, G719A, G719CIncreased responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 719 in exon 18 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy (slightly more than 50%), although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21. Reference (1)L858RIncreased responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L858R in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation or receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)L861QIncreased  responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L861Q in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)S768ILack of responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy. Reference (2)T790MLack of responsiveness to TKIsT790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs.  It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone. Reference (3)Exon 20 InsertionLack of responsiveness to TKIsInsertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations.  This is a rare mutation, however, and robust clinical data is lacking. Reference (2)References:(1)  **NAME[VVV, UUU M]. et al.  N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004.\n(2  )Wu, Jenn-Yu et al.

The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample.  Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene.  Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.  \n\nIntended Use:  The EGFR mutation analysis be real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI' s.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva)./r/n\n"

Neoplastic cells grow in sheet\nlike groups and are composed of cells with enlarged nuclei often with a\nprominent nucleolus. Several mitotic figures are noted. The cell borders\nare not well defined. Some cells have a slightly spindled appearance. \nThe epithelial nature of these cells is confirmed with an\nimmunohistochemical stain showing diffuse and strong positive\nimmunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7. There is variable but strong positive\nimmunoreactivity for TTF-1 which is typical for tumors primary to the\nlung. The cells are negative with stains for p63 and cytokeratin 5&6. This\npattern would favor adenocarcinoma over squamous cell carcinoma. An\nimmunostain for S-100 protein is negative excluding melanoma.

The cells contain slightly enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with punctuate, variably sized nucleoli.  There is cellular crowding with occasional mitotic figures.  The findings are felt to indicate the presence of adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung primary.

Container designation: \"left breast mass\" -- Specimen orientation:\nyes, previously inked and oriented by surgeon. The specimen is inked as\nfollows: anterior - blue, posterior (deep) - black, medial - orange,\nlateral - yellow, superior - red, inferior - green.  Specimen size: 5.5\n(medial-lateral) x 2.0 (anterior-posterior) x 5.2 (superior-inferior) cm.\nSkin ellipse: None.  Localization wire/pins: yes, one localization wire\nentering medial aspect of specimen, one placed pin.  Specimen radiograph:\nyes, sent to pathologist.  Focal mass lesion(s): yes, there is a 0.9 x 0.9\nx 0.7 cm well circumscribed firm mass in a mid portion of the specimen\nassociated with the location of the placed pin and intraparenchymal needle\nlocalization wire.  The mass is 0.8 cm from the deep margin, and 1.0 cm or\ngreater from the remainder of the margins.  Contiguous and adjacent to the\nmass is nodular dense fibrous tissue.  Benign-appearing parenchyma contains\nabout 15-20% fibrous stroma.  Cassettes representative in blocks A1-A10\nsequentially from medial to lateral to include the mass and closest margins\nin blocks A4-A5, blocks A6-A10 include the contiguous fibrous tissue with\nthe mass, includes nodular component.\nB.   Container designation: \"right breast mass\" -- Specimen orientation:\nyes, previously inked and oriented by surgeon.  The specimen is inked as\nfollows: anterior - blue, posterior (deep) - black, medial - orange,\nlateral - yellow, superior - red, inferior - green.  Specimen size: 6.5\n(medial-lateral) x 3.0 (anterior-posterior) x 7.5 (superior-inferior) cm.\nSkin ellipse: None.  Localization wire/pins: yes, one localization wire\nentering medial aspect of specimen, three placed multi-colored hubbed pins.\nSpecimen radiograph: yes, sent to pathologist.  Focal mass lesion(s): yes,\nthere is a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm irregular bordered mass in the medial third\nof the specimen associated with the location of the localization wire and a\nsingle placed pin.  The mass is 0.6 cm from the inferior margin and deep\nmargins, and is 1.0 cm or greater from the remainder of the margins.\nAdjacent and contiguous with the definitive mass is dense suspicious\nfibrous tissue in the remainder of the specimen  (lateral two thirds of\nspecimen).  The dense suspicious fibrous tissue contiguous with the mass\ncontains the remainder of placed pins.  Benign-appearing parenchyma\ncontains about 15-20% fibrous stroma.  Cassettes representative in blocks\nB1-B10 sequentially from medial to lateral to include the definitive mass\nin blocks B2-B3 and closest margins, blocks B4-B10 include sequential\nadjacent sections of suspicious dense fibrous tissue, includes additional\nareas of placed pins.\nC.   Container designation: \"right inferior margin\" --  The specimen\nconsists of an oriented 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm portion of breast tissue with an\nattached undesignated clip.  The tissue subjacent of the clip is inked red\nand the remainder of the specimen is inked black.  The cut surfaces are\nfocally fibrotic, but otherwise unremarkable.  Entirely in C1-C3.\nD.   Container designation: \"4 right breast margin deep\" --  The specimen\nconsists of an oriented 1.6 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm portion of breast tissue with an\nattached undesignated clip.

The procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis) by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2 probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe reactivity.  Analysis  The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.  A ratio between 1.8-2.2 is considered equivocal amplification.  References   1) Wolff A.C. et al.

Due to the cautery artifact, the\nmorphology of these glands cannot be well discerned. A triple stain was\nattempted, and while there is no definite differential staining to suggest\na basal layer, due to the cautery artifact, interpretation is not\ndefinitive. This may represent a microscopic focus of carcinoma; however\nthis interpretation is inideterminate.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA:  Bladder neck:  Negative for tumor.  (XX)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 4.  Labeled with patient\nname: **NAME[AAA BBB], MRN: **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"Bladder neck\" --  The specimen consists of\nthree tan-pink fragments of tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.3, 0.5 x 0.4 x\n0.3 and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The fragments are submitted for frozen now\nentirely for permanent in A1.\nB.  Container designation: \"Ileal obturator lymph nodes\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 4 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue.  Careful\npalpation of the tissue reveals a single 1.1 cm presumed lymph node which\nis bisected and submitted entirely in B1.  The remainder of the tissue is\nsubmitted in B2 and B3.\nC.  Container designation: \"Right obturator lymph node\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.7 x\n0.8 cm.  The specimen is carefully palpated with no definitive lymph nodes\nidentified.  Possible lymph nodes are submitted whole in C1.  The remainder\nof the tissue is submitted in C2 and C3.\nD.  Container designation: \"Prostate\" --  The specimen consists of a 45 gm\nradical prostatectomy specimen measuring 3.5 cm from apex to base, 4.8 cm\nlaterally and 3.2 cm anterior posteriorly.  The urethra is probe patent.\nThe posterior bladder surface is smooth and intact.  The anterior and basal\nsurface have prominent cautery artifact.  Also attached are bilateral vas\ndeferentia and seminal vesicles.  The prostate has a firm spongy\nconsistency and is vaguely nodular.  The exterior surface of the prostate\nis differentially inked as follows: left anterior   blue, left posterior\ngreen, right anterior   black, right posterior   red.  The prostate has\nbeen serially sectioned from apex to base revealing multiple yellow-tan\nnodules imbedded in a pink tan stroma.  The nodules are present in all\nquadrants of the prostate.  There is no grossly apparent extension beyond\nthe prostatic parenchyma, however a prominent portion is present within 0.1\ncm of the inked posterior margin in the mid prostate.  Cassette summary: D1\nand D2   right and left apex, respectively (level one), D3 and D4   right\nand left level two, D5 and D6   right and left level three, D7 and D8\nposterior right and left level six, D9 and D10   lateral right and left\nlevel five, D11   left insertion of seminal vesicle into prostate base, D12\n  left representative vas deferens and seminal vesicle, D13   right seminal\nvesicle insertion into prostate base, D14   representative right vas and\nseminal vesicle, D15   right and left prostate base.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[XXX WWW], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Dec 08 2012] 10:57 AM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

The findings will be reported in an addendum.  Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Oct 22 2011].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right colon\" is a segment of small bowel (12 cm in length by 3.5 cm in diameter) and a segment of large bowel (15 cm in length by 4 cm in diameter).  A smooth tan appendix (6.9 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm) is attached to the cecum of the large bowel.  The serosa of the small and large bowel are smooth, tan-red.  The proximal and distal resection margins are stapled.  The staples are removed and the revised proximal and distal resection margins are inked black.  The radial resection margin is also inked black.  The specimen is opened to reveal tan mucosa.  Two possible tan polyps (0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm) are found in the large bowel located 9 cm and 8 cm away from the distal resection margin, respectively.  A large firm mass causes a complete obstruction at the ileocecal junction (5 x 4 x 4 cm).  Upon sectioning the obstructed area reveals a firm and fibrous tan-yellow submucosal mass (approximately 3.5 x 3 x 3 cm) located at the ileocecal junction and at the base of the appendix.  The mass grossly approaches 11 cm within the proximal resection margin, 13.5 cm within the distal resection margin, 3 cm within the radial resection margin and grossly appears to extend to the serosal surface.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock Summary:\n1)  -  Perpendicular section of proximal resection margin.\n2)  -  Perpendicular section of distal resection margin.\n3)  -  En face section of radial resection margin.\n4)  -  Section of proximal end of appendix.\n5)  -  Additional cross sections of appendix.\n6)  -  Section of distal tip of appendix.\n7)  -  Two possible polyps found in large bowel.\n8)  -  Section of mass with base of appendix.\n9-16)  -  Additional sections of submucosal mass.\n17)  -  Section of mass with polypoid obstruction.\n18)  -  Sections of grossly normal small bowel proximal from the mass.\n19)  -  Sections of grossly normal large bowel distal from the mass. \n20)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n21)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n22)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n23)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n24)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n25)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n26)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n27)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n28)  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\n29)  -  One possible lymph node.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right colon\nAddendumComment:\nIn addition to the one lymph node noted in the initial report to be involved with carcinoma by direct extension, one other node shows 7 PCK positive tumor cells in the subcapsular sinus (positive for isolated tumor cells).  The PCK stain was examined after the initial report was generated.  The presence if isolated tumor cells in this other lymph node is of uncertain clinical significance.\n"

In non-small cell lung\ncancer, this type of activating EGFR mutation is reported to correlate with\nresponsiveness to anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase therapy. This real time PCR assay\nhas been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain\nmutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell\nlung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor\ntypes is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to\ndiagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is\nintended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select\neligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok\net al., NEJM 2009; **ID-NUM, Pao et al., JClinOnc 2005; **ID-NUM).\nMATERIAL RECEIVED\nA1 = ***PATH-NUMBER[1], B1, 1 Block (**DATE[Apr 10 2012])\nPROCEDURE DATE\n**DATE[Apr 09 2012]\nCLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY\nEGFR by PCR \nEGFR PCR METHODS\nThis real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating\nmutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell\ncancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of\nmutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not\ndistinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and\nG719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20\ninsertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the\ntypes). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR\nmutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19\ndeletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this\nassay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified\ngenomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by\nlow volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR\nassay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type\nand mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are\ncalculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant\nreaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative\nand positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is\nestimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. \nMETHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample\nof tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same\ntumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these\nareas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay\nproduces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In\ninstances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to\nthe wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,\nleading to a false-negative result.     \n    Electronically signed **DATE[Apr 14 2012]: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD-Pathologist\n M.D., Pathologist\nPer CMS regulations, the pathologist's signature above indicates that this\ncase has been reviewed and the diagnosis made or confirmed by said\npathologist.\nNote: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by PhenoPath Laboratories. They have not been\ncleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However,\nthe FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nPursuant to the requirements of CLIA, this laboratory has established and\nverified the accuracy and precision of all tests, and additional information\nabout these tests is available upon request. PhenoPath Laboratories is\ncertified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)\nas qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.\n\n"

In addition, there is dim, partial expression for T cell marker, CD7 and no significant expression for TdT or other surface or cytoplasmic antigens associated with T- or B-lineage differentiation.  \n\nThere is also a CD45 (moderate intensity) abnormal monocyte population (moderate in size by light scatter; with higher side scatter characteristics, 56% of all cells) which expresses CD4 (dim), CD11b (strong), CD13 (strong), CD14 (My4, partial), CD15 (moderate), CD16 (partial), CD33, CD36 (dim-moderate), CD38, CD56 (dim, partial), CD64 (moderate), and myeloperoxidase.  There is no significant expression for CD7, CD14 (Mo2), CD34, and CD117.  \n\nThe overall findings are interpreted as showing a CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic features.\n\nThis test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review.  **INSTITUTION Pathology Laboratory, which is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing, has developed this test's performance characteristics.

Received fresh, previously opened and unoriented, labeled \"XXXXXX, **NAME[AAA], sigmoid colon\" is an unoriented segment of pink-tan, intestinal tissue measuring up to 13.5 cm in length x 9.0 cm in greatest circumference. There is a well-circumscribed, centrally ulcerated and necrotic tumor measuring 5.3 x 4.2 x 0.5 cm.  The tumor is approximately 2.7 cm away from one margin, which has been inked blue, and approximately 5.5 cm away from the opposite margin, which has been inked orange.  The mass is nearly circumferential.  The underlying fat and serosal surface is inked black beneath the tumor.  Sectioning of the tumor reveals that it penetrates through the muscularis propria and does extend to the serosa and fat.  There are two suspicious, shaggy-appearing areas at the blue margin.  Examination of the fat reveals multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.7 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.  \n\n  KEY TO CASSETTES:\n  A1    -  Orange shave margin\n  A2    -  Blue shave margin and one perpendicular representative section of the margin\n  A3-A7    -  Tumor and deepest penetrating area through the serosa\n  A8-A10    -  Tumor and extension into the fat\n  A11, A12  -  Shaggy area #1\n  A13, A14  -  Shaggy area #2\n  A15    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A16    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A17    -  Two lymph nodes\n  A18    -  One lymph node (trisected)\n  A19    -  One lymph node\n  A20    -  Two lymph nodes\n  A21    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A22    -  Two lymph nodes \n\n        Lymph nodes within cassettes within A15-A19 are lymph nodes underlying the tumor, and lymph nodes in cassettes A20-A22 \n        are lymph nodes present closer to the orange-inked margin.  \n\nB.

Within the desmoplastic stroma are scattered round to oval cells which stain positively with both cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (establishing an epithelial origin) and estrogen receptor (ER).  The findings are consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma.

The nodule measures approximately 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. in greatest dimensions.  The external surface is marked with black ink.  The specimen is sectioned and submitted in toto in A. The thyroid lobe weighs 5 grams and measures 4.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. in greatest dimensions. There is a defect near one pole.  The external surface is brown-gray and slightly irregular. On sectioning, near the opposite pole of the defect is seen a round white oval structure measuring approximately 0.7 cm. in diameter.  The remainder of the cut surface of the thyroid is reddish-brown and granular.  Representative sections are submitted in B-E with the white nodule in B-D.           PATHOLOGY REPORT   \\T\\a9.3L   \nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION   Sections consist of segments of thyroid gland within which is seen a focus of classical type papillary thyroid carcinoma.  Tumor cells in papillary-like formations and have enlarged round nuclei with nuclear clearing and numerous linear grooves.  The tumor extends through a thick capsule into the surrounding benign thyroid tissue.  In one area is seen a small individual malignant acini several millimeters from the tumor.  The tumor extends to within less than 1 mm of the surgical margin focally.  Maximum tumor size is 1 cm.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Extrathyroidal extension is not noted.   A second smaller 3 mm diameter tumor is noted in the thyroid consisting of a Hurthle cell adenoma.   The second separately received segment of thyroid gland appears to be that of a benign adenoma. \nSPECIMEN   RIGHT LOBE THYROID --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   PATHOLOGY REPORT\n"

Container designation: \"left kidney and adrenal gland\"   The specimen\nconsists of a left kidney and adrenal gland weighing in total 650 gm and\nmeasuring 21 x 14 x 8 cm.  The surrounding perirenal fat varies in\nthickness from 1 to 3 cm.  Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (7.5\ncm in length, 0.3 cm in diameter) renal artery (1.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in\ndiameter) and renal vein (1.0 cm in length, 1.1 cm in diameter).  The\nureter, renal artery and renal vein are all opened to reveal patent lumens\nwith no grossly visible involvement of tumor.  Located primarily in the\nlower pole is a 6.9 x 5.9 x 5.5 diffuse, poorly circumscribed golden yellow\ntumor without areas of necrosis.  The tumor pushes against the renal\ncapsule and in areas appears to possibly penetrate the capsule and invade\ninto the perirenal fat, but tumor is not present at the deep surgical\nmargin. The tumor does not appear to invade into the ureter, renal artery\nor renal vein.  The remainder of the renal cortex is brown with a\nwell-defined cortico-medullary junction.  The renal pelvis and calices are\ncovered with smooth glistening mucosa.  The adrenal gland consists of\nnormal medulla and cortex without focal lesions.  Representative cassettes\nare submitted as follows:  A1   margins of ureter, renal vein and renal\nartery; A2   adrenal gland; A3-A5   renal capsule and perirenal fat with\narea of possible tumor penetration through the capsule in A3; A6-A7   tumor\nand adjacent hilar fat; A8   tumor adjacent to normal-appearing parenchyma;\nA9   additional section of tumor; A10   normal-appearing parenchyma.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[YYY XXX], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[WWW VVV], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Apr 02 2012] 05:24 PM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast, upper inner' consists of two unoriented fibrofatty tissue fragments together weighing 19.7 gm.  \nThe first fibrofatty tissue fragment measures 5.9 x 2 x 0.7 cm.  One very slightly convex yellow lobulated to tan flat aspect is inked blue and the opposite flat to very slightly concave rubbery tan-pink, slightly coarse aspect is inked black.  Tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft to rubbery tan-pink to yellow fibrofatty cut surfaces throughout.  This tissue fragment is entirely submitted sequentially in cassettes A1-A5.  \nThe second tissue fragment in part A measures 5.3 x 3.5 x 2 cm.  A localization guidewire is partially embedded near one edge of the specimen.  No orientation is provided.  This tissue fragment is inked blue and serially sectioned into seven slices revealing a circular metal clip in slice 2 abutting the blue inked margin.  The cut surfaces otherwise show uniform rubbery tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue throughout with no discrete masses, lesions, or areas of induration.  This tissue fragment is entirely submitted sequentially as follows:  A6-A7 perpendicular sections of slice 1, A8-A12 slices 2-6 submitted sequentially, A13-A14 perpendicular sections of slice 7.\nB.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast, upper outer (wire lateral/clip anterior)' consists of an oriented fibrofatty tissue fragment weighing 13.3 gm and measuring 5.3 cm from medial to lateral, 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior and 1.5 cm from superior to inferior.  The tail end of the localization guidewire extends from the lateral aspect and the metal surgical clip is identified on the anterior aspect.  With the provided orientation, the specimen is differentially inked to allow for microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  superior - blue, inferior - green, posterior - black, anterior - yellow, medial - purple, lateral - orange.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medial toward lateral into nine slices revealing uniform soft tan-yellow fibrofatty cut surfaces throughout.  There are no discrete masses, lesions or areas of induration identified.  Specimen is entirely submitted sequentially as follows:\nB1-B2 perpendicular sections of slice 1, B3-B9 slices 2-8 submitted sequentially, B10-B11 perpendicular sections of slice 9.\nC.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'additional tissue inferior margin, clip old margin' consists of a rubbery fibrous irregular tissue fragment measuring 3.6 x 2 x 0.9 cm and weighing 4.3 gm.  The old margin designated by a single metal surgical clip is inked black and the opposite new margin is inked blue.  Tissue is serially sectioned into eight slices revealing uniform soft to rubbery tan-white to dusky purple-red fibrofatty cut surfaces.  There are no discrete masses or areas of induration identified.  The specimen is entirely submitted sequentially in cassettes C1-C4.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jul 1 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA.  Sections, including those demonstrating the microscopic margins, are examined.  In addition, tissue block A7 was evaluated immunohistochemically with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, p63, and E-cadherin immunostains.  These immunostains demonstrate a focus of invasive carcinoma characterized by absence of a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain/p63 myoepithelial layer.  The E-cadherin immunostain is negative in this area of invasive carcinoma, which is a characteristic finding of invasive lobular carcinoma.\nB.

As this case demonstrates 2+ staining for HER-2/neu, HER-2/neu by FISH will be performed and an addendum will be issued once the study is complete.  \n_____________________________________________________________________\nImmunohistochemical evaluation is performed by manual quantitative/semiquantitative morphometric analysis.\nImmunohistochemical evaluation of estrogen receptor is performed is using DAKO monoclonal  mouse antihuman estrogen receptor alpha clone 1D5.  Progesterone receptor evaluation is performed using DAKO monoclonal mouse antihuman progesterone receptor clone PgR636.  Ki-67 evaluation is performed using DAKO monoclonal mouse antihuman  Ki-67 antigen clone MIB-1.  Her-2 neu evaluation is performed using DAKO polyclonal rabbit antihuman c-erbB-2 oncoprotein code No. A 0485.  Unless otherwise indicated, these studies are performed using the DAKO auto stainer used with paraffin embedded formalin-fixed sections which have undergone heat-induced epitope retrieval in Target Retrieval Solution.  DAKO Envision+/HRP kit is used for visualization.\n*  If less than 1% of tumor cells are positive for estrogen or progesterone receptor, the tumor is considered to be negative for hormone receptor expression per ASCO-CAP 2010 guidelines.\n**  A false negative cannot be ruled out in the presence of inadequate controls.\n*** Negative (0) - no staining or membrane staining < 10% tumor cells.\n   Negative (1+) - faint partial membrane staining > 10% tumor cells.\n   Weak positive (2+) - weak to moderate complete membrane staining > 10% tumor cells.\n   Strong positive (3+) -  uniform intense complete membrane staining > 30% tumor cells.\n****  When discordance exists between cell proliferation as determined by ki-67 antigen and histologic mitotic count, the           \nhigher of the two determinations should be used.  Ki-67 antigen is sensitive to tissue fixation and may show a falsely low  proliferation index.\n\n\n<ADDENDUM>\nIMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL CANCER MARKER STUDIES REPORT\nESTROGEN RECEPTOR:    POSITIVE\n*Percent cells positive:  98%\nStaining intensity:     Strong\n  Internal Controls:    Positive\nPROGESTERONE RECEPTOR:  POSITIVE\n  *Percent cells positive:  48%\n  Staining intensity:         Weak\n  Internal Controls:    Positive\nCerbB2 (HER-2 NEU) ONCOGENE OVEREXPRESSION:  \n          INDETERMINATE\n  ***Score:        2+ (32% of cells demonstrate moderate membranous\n            staining).\n  Internal Controls:    Present\nKi-67 Antigen:****      Low (<10%)\n  \nPercent cells positive:    3%, HER-2 by FISH was performed at PhenoPath Laboratories and was found to be negative for gene amplification.

The greatest radiographic dimension noted was 1.2 cm.  Clinical correlation is recommended. HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) Immunohistochemistry Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of this oncoprotein is performed by the immunoperoxidase method, and reported according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) Guideline Recommendations (2006). IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION:  CELL MEMBRANE STAINING ONLY (DAKO Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human c-erB-2 Oncoprotein Antibody) NEGATIVE:  Score 0 (No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of the tumor cells). NEGATIVE:  Score 1+ (A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is seen in more than 10% of the tumor cells.  The cells are only stained in part of their membrane). WEAK POSITIVE:  Score 2+ (A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells). STRONG POSITIVE:  Score 3+ (A strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 30% of the tumor cells). The results of this test are for investigational purposes as its performance characteristics have not been established.  It should be noted that according to the literature, the sensitivity for immunohistochemical HER-2/neu determination is no greater than 80% when compared to molecular or FISH methods. Primary antibody:  C-erb B.2 oncoprotein (polyclonal rabbit Dako ID# A0485) Detection system:  Dakocytoenvision (+) R System HRP (DAB) The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.

Please\nevaluate for APL.\nCASE: ***path number ***\nPATIENT: **NAME[AAA BBB\nDIAGNOSIS:\nBONE MARROW ASPIRATE; FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS:\n- ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, IMMUNOPHENOTYPE MOST SUGGESTIVE OF ACUTE\nPROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (SEE COMMENT)\n\nCOMMENT:\nFlow cytometric analysis identifies an increased number of\nblasts/promyelocytes (81%) in this bone marrow aspirate specimen that\nexpress CD117, CD33, CD13, subset CD56, dim CD45, and dim CD64. The\nmajority of blasts lacks CD34, CD15 and show loss of HLA-DR expression,\nmost compatible with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  This diagnosis is\nfurther suggested by the limited morphology (cytospin preparation).  A\ndefinitive diagnosis of APL requires FISH/cytogenetic confirmation. FISH\nfor t(15;17) is in progress, as is cytogenetic analysis, and will be\nreported separately.  As blast percentages in bone marrow specimens are\naltered by hemodilution and lysis of red blood cell precursors, the blast\npercentage may not be accurate and is best determined by morphologic\nevaluation. Correlation with the bone marrow morphology and clinical\nfindings is required for complete interpretation of the findings.\n\nThe results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Oct 30 11].\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a prominent population of intermediate to\nlarge sized blasts. The intermediate sized blasts have a high nuclear to\ncytoplasmic ratio, fine nuclear chromatin, and moderately abundant\ncytoplasm. The larger cells have irregular nuclear contours, prominent\nnucleoli, and more abundant granulated cytoplasm with an appearance most\nsuggestive of neoplastic promyelocytes (blast equivalents).  Auer rods are\npresent with more than one Auer rod detected in some cells.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nViability:  80%\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3  CD4  CD7  CD8  CD10  CD13  CD14\nCD15  CD19  CD20  CD33  CD34  CD36  CD45  CD56  CD64  CD117  HLA-DR  kappa\nlambda\n\nBlasts:\nIncreased blasts identified, see comment above.  Approximately 5% of cells\nexpress CD34. The blasts do not express CD19, CD10, CD4, CD14, CD36, or\nCD15.\n\nLymphoid population:\nPolytypic B-cells account for 1% of total events and have a normal\nkappa:lambda light chain ratio of 1.6:1.\n\nApproximately 11% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 1.5:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression with the antibodies\nexamined.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nA minority of recorded events (6%) are CD33 positive maturing myeloid\ncells.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[YYY XXX] WWW], PhD\nXXXXX Hematopathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Oct 30 2011] 11:53 AM\nSPECIMEN:\n\n\nReferral ID #:\n# Unstained Slides:\n# Stained Slides:\n# Blocks:\nSpecimen Type:      Bone Marrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: CD117+ blasts (red)\nA: CD13+, loss of HLA-DR\nA: Majority CD34- CD15-\n"

Located 6.0 cm distal to the mass lesion is a tan-pink, polypoid lesion measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.  Representative sections are submitted in blocks 1-12.\n\nSECTION SUMMARY:\n1  -  Proximal margin\n2  -  Distal margin\n3-7  -  Sections through cecal lesion\n8  -  Polyp\n9-12  -  Lymph nodes.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nProximal and distal margins are free of carcinoma.  The cecal mass is an invasive, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma exhibiting extensive necrosis and inflammation.  Tumor infiltrates through the muscular wall into subserosal fat.  In addition to the main cecal adenocarcinoma, there is a small tubular adenoma.  2 of 12 identified nodes are positive for metastasis.\nA: Right colon\n"

JFJ/mbc  COMMENT:  This report was faxed to the radiologist at Central Baptist Breast Imaging Services on **DATE[Aug 30 2012].\nGross Description The specimen, labeled left breast stereotactic biopsy, received in formalin, consists of a 2.5x2.5x0.3 cm aggregate of tan/pink fibroadipose breast tissue fragments which were placed in formalin at 1:45 and are now submitted in one cassette.  HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections show focal area of intraductal proliferation of cells with enlarged nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli with a variable solid and cribriform architecture. This is present as several 1 mm foci. Focal involvement of adjacent lobules is noted. There is no evidence of luminal necrosis. A tiny focus of microinvasive carcinoma is seen as well.  JFJ/mbc  ADDITIONAL MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: All controls stain appropriately including external positive, internal negative and external negative controls as required.  This tumor shows POSITIVE 3+ nuclear staining for Estrogen Receptor (over 90% of tumor nuclei) and POSITIVE 2+ staining for Progesterone Receptor (over 70% of tumor nuclei).  HER2/Neu antibody shows absolutely no staining in any of the tumor with a membranous pattern (0+, negative).

Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and is labeled \\\"right fallopian tube and ovary\\\" and consists of the aforementioned weighing 60.5 grams and measuring 7 x 4 x 6 cm in greatest dimension.  There is a purple-tan cystic structure extruding from a more firm pink-tan area measuring 3 cm in diameter and another pedunculated area of small cystic structures and firm areas extends on a thread of connective tissue which is 3 cm long and measures itself 3 x 2 x 1 cm.  An attached portion of fallopian tube is present measuring 8 cm in length by 1.5 cm in greatest diameter.  The serosal surface is inked in black and the specimen is sectioned to reveal a firm yellow-tan parenchyma containing multiple simple cystic spaces without excrescences and some hemorrhagic-filled cystic structures as well.  Representative sections are submitted from the varying architectural areas as 1FS-1 and 1FS-2.  The previously frozen 1FS-1 and 1FS-2 are entirely resubmitted as such and sections from the unfrozen tissue are submitted in cassettes A-C. Specimen two is labeled \\\"right internal iliac obturator\\\" and consists of a cluster of fibro-fatty tissue.  The total cluster measures 3 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm.  The entire cluster is fibro-fatty.  No true lymph nodes are seen.  The entire cluster is submitted in cassettes labeled 2A and 2B. Specimen three is labeled \\\"external commons\\\" and consists of two clusters of fibro-fatty rubbery tissue.  The total cluster measures 3 x 2 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and shows more fat.  Very little lymphoid material is identified, if any.  All of the tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 3. Specimen four is labeled \\\"right common and periaortic\\\" and consists of a red-tan fragment of tissue.  The total cluster measures 2.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm.  The cluster of tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 4. Specimen five is labeled \\\"left internal opturator\\\" and consists of a triangle of fibro-fatty rubbery tissue measuring 3 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and shows lymphoid material.  The entire cluster of lymphoid material and adjacent structures are submitted in one cassette labeled 5A. Specimen six is labeled \\\"left common and periaortic\\\" and consists of a cluster of fatty tissue.  No lymphoid material is seen.  The total cluster measures 2.5 x 2 x 0.3 cm.  All fragments are submitted in one cassette labeled 6A. Specimen seven is labeled \\\"left external iliac commons\\\" and consists of fibro-fatty irregular rubbery tissue.  The total cluster in two parts with one measuring 0.5 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.3 cm.  Both fragments are submitted in one cassette labeled 7A. Specimen eight is labeled \\\"omentum\\\" and consists of a lace-like pattern of fatty tissue compatible with omentum which has a measurement of 8 x 4 x 0.5 cm.  Sections made perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of this portion of omentum show lobules of fatty tissue.  No lymph nodes are seen by gross inspection.  Representative sections are submitted in one cassette labeled 8A. Specimen nine is labeled \\\"cervix, uterus, left tube and left ovarie\\\" and consists of a uterus with attached ovary, left.  The uterus includes endocervical canal and a portion of the cervix.  The specimen weighs 370 grams and has a measurement of 13 cm and a width of 10 cm and a thickness of 7.2 cm.  The left ovary is tubular and cylindrical shaped and measures 6 x 2 x 2.2 cm.  The fallopian tube measures 6 cm. Greatest diameter of the ovary 5 cm.  The fimbriated end appears satisfactory.  The uterus is sectioned from the anterior posterior plane sagittally and shows a thickening and mass effect of the posterior central portion of the body of uterus.  The specimen is allowed adequate fixation prior to further section in order to preserve the tumor and the extent of tumor that might be present and degree of invasion.  The serosal surface of both these portions of the uterus is intact, smooth and uninvolved by tumor. The uterus is sectioned sagittally and now shows a satisfactory fixation process.  The left ovary and fallopian tube measures 5 x 2 cm.  The ovary is sectioned and shows well-fixed pink-tan stromal process.  Cystic follicles are present along the subcordical surface of this process.  A section of this ovary is submitted in one cassette.  A section of the fimbriated fallopian tube segment measures 5 x 1 cm.  Section is submitted in cassette labeled 9B.  No tumor is seen in these sections.  Sections of the site of the attachment of the ovary and the fallopian tube are submitted in one cassette labeled 9C.  No tumor is seen by gross inspection at this focus.  The sagittally sectioned body of the uterus is now sectioned perpendicular to the transverse axis and shows a superficial process of tumor on the endometrial surface.  A section of this process is submitted in cassette labeled 9D.  The process extends into the lower uterine segment.  A section from the lower uterine segment of the body of the uterus is submitted in cassette labeled 9E.  The process does not extend to the cervix.  Sections of the anterior and posterior lip of the cervix are submitted in cassette labeled 9F.  No tumor is seen in this extension either.  The opposite half of the body of the uterus is sectioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and shows the tumor size to be 1.5 cm.  The body of the uterus measures 3.7 cm from the base of the tumor.  A section showing the tumor and this involvement of the superficial portion of the endometrium reveal an extension of the tumor.  A section showing the superficial area of the tumor is submitted in cassette labeled 9G.  A section of the extent of tumor into the wall of the uterus is submitted in cassette labeled 9H.  The tumor extends on this particular focus a distance of 3 cm and the myometrium residual without tumor involvement is 1.2 cm at this focus. The serosal surface is free of metastatic disease.  Another section of the tumor that is well fixed showing the deep margin of resection of this tumor adjacent to a portion of the softened poorly fixed area is submitted in cassettes labeled 9I and 9J.\nMICROSCOPIC HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, not otherwise characterized HISTOLOGIC GRADE: FIGO grade 1 MYOMETRIAL INVASION: Present Depth of invasion: 0.2 cm Myometrial thickness: 3.7 cm INVOLVEMENT OF CERVIX: Not involved EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER ORGANS RIGHT OVARY: Not involved LEFT OVARY: Not involved RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE: Not involved LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE: Not involved MARGINS: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pT1apN0) PRIMARY TUMOR: pT1a REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pN0 Pelvic lymph nodes Number examined: 7 Number involved: 0 Para-aortic lymph nodes: Number examined: 2 Number involved: 0 DISTANT METASTASIS: Not applicable ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS Complex hyperplasia CLINICAL HISTORY Stein-Leventhal Syndrome ANCILLARY STUDIES (Cytology performed in interpreted at P\\T\\C Laboratories) CYTOLOGY RESULTS (11-PM-25) See separate outside report PELVIC WASHING:  Negative for malignant cells.

Left breast mass:  \n\nBreast Tumor Information:\n\nType of specimen(s):  Left breast biopsy\nHistologic Type:  Ductal carcinoma-in-situ, see comment\nSize:  High grade dysplasia and in-situ carcinoma extend over an area estimated at 1.3 cm in greatest dimension\nArchitectural pattern(s):  Predominantly solid\nNuclear grade:  Nuclear grade 3 out of 3\nNecrosis:  Not identified\nMicrocalcifications:  Not identified\nResection margins:  Margins free of in-situ ductal carcinoma\nAdditional findings:  Receptor studies requested.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThe specimen is removed at 15:55 on **DATE[Aug 7 2011] and placed in formalin at 16:28 on **DATE[Aug 7 2011].  It is submitted for processing to begin at 10:30 pm on **DATE[Aug 8 2011].\n\nPlease correlate with prior biopsy.\n\nADDENDUM:  Outside slides from initial core needle biopsy (***PATH-NUMBER[1]) shows definite invasive ductal carcinoma.  Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] has reviewed both the initial core needle biopsy and the excisional biopsy.\nGrossDescription:\nA.  Node, left axilla:  Received fresh for frozen section is a fatty lymph node.  On section, it is grossly free of tumor.  Touch preps are performed:  NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA.  DLW 3:30 pm.  Specimen submitted for permanent sections.\n \nB.  Left breast mass:  Received is a fatty breast biopsy measuring up to 9 x 7 x 2.5 cm.  The specimen is oriented with a double suture, a single suture, and a wire.  The specimen is roughly pancake in shape.  The double suture is located on the superficial aspect of the biopsy (inked red).  The opposite bottom aspect is inked green.  A single suture is located at one medial edge (inked black) and the opposite edge is (inked blue).  The wire is located 90 degrees from the single suture.  This edge is (inked yellow) and the edge opposite to the wire is (inked orange).  On section, an ill-defined area of hemorrhagic discoloration extends over an area of 2 cm in greatest dimension.  The closest surgical margin is inked green.  Representative sections submitted through cassette B9.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Node, left axilla:  Sections of the lymph node are free of metastatic carcinoma.  Cytokeratin stains are also negative for metastatic carcinoma.\n \nB.  Left breast mass:  Slides B8 and B9 demonstrate areas suggestive of a prior biopsy with granulation tissue formation, inflammation, fibrosis, and hemorrhage.  The adjacent stroma demonstrates a duct with in-situ ductal carcinoma and comedonecrosis as well as a few small nests in which a clear myoepithelial layer is not appreciated on H and E stain.  However on myosin staining, these nests do demonstrate a myoepithelial layer.  Nuclei appear high grade.  Throughout this section as well as much of the remainder of the sampled breast, there is evidence of fat necrosis.  Slide B2 also demonstrates areas of high grade ductal carcinoma-in-situ as well as a few nests of invasive ductal carcinoma.  Definite vascular or neural invasion is not appreciated.\nA: Node, left axilla\nB: Left breast mass\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nPROGNOSTIC PANEL SUMMARY\n\n\nEstrogen receptor (clone 1D5):    Positive\nProgesterone receptor (clone PgR 636):  Negative\nHER-2/neu (HercepTest):      Equivocal\n\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, see image analysis report for complete analytic results.\n\nHER-2/neu (FISH):  Positive for amplification.\nAddendumComment:\nHER-2/neu analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization shows a HER-2/chromosome 17 ratio of 3.3.\n\n\nTesting performed at Clarient Diagnostic Services, **PLACE, CA.\n"

Per outside report (**ID-NUM), immunohistochemistry stains were performed on the biopsy from **DATE[Mar 19 2012] and the tumor is negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2.  Ki-67 demonstrated a high proliferative index of >50%.\n\n<GROSS>\nReceived in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated 'left breast tissue, short suture at Tail of **NAME[ZZZ], long suture marks tumor skin boundary,' is a 160 gm simple left mastectomy specimen with short suture designating Tail of **NAME[ZZZ] and long suture marking tumor skin boundary, per the requisition.  The breast measures 9.1 cm from superior to inferior, 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 15.3 cm from medial to lateral.  A tan-pink skin ellipse is present on the anterior surface measuring 13.8 cm from medial to lateral x 8.1 cm from superior to inferior.  A V-shaped incision is present on the left tip of the skin ellipse, which measures 7.2 cm from superior to inferior, and is located 1.5 cm from the most lateral skin tip.  An everted nipple measuring 1.1 cm in diameter x 0.9 cm in length is located in the central aspect of the skin, with a 3.1 cm areolar surrounding the nipple.  The specimen is differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  anterior-superior resection margin   blue, anterior-inferior resection margin   green, and posterior resection margin   black.  Sectioning reveals a firm, round, well-circumscribed mass measuring 1.5 cm from medial to lateral, 1.3 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.3 cm from anterior to posterior.  The mass is located 0.1 cm from the closest black-inked posterior resection margin, 0.9 cm from the closest blue-inked anterior-superior resection margin, 2.0 cm from the closest green-inked anterior-inferior resection margin, 0.8 cm deep to the skin, and 7.0 cm from the nipple.  The mass is located in the lower-outer quadrant.  The mass has a tan-white homogeneous and rubbery cut surface.  The mass is located 0.9 cm deep to the skin incision.  Located 1.0 cm from the mass is an ill-defined nodule area of tan-white dense fibrous tissue, measuring 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  A localization clip is identified within the central portion of the mass.  The breast immediately deep to the nipple is tan-white to chalky white soft and friable, grossly appearing to be necrotic.  The remaining uninvolved breast tissue consists of approximately 40% tan-white dense fibrous tissue admixed with 60% tan-yellow, glistening and lobulated unremarkable breast tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of sections:  A1 nipple, A2 full thickness section through mass with closest black-inked posterior resection margin, A3 full thickness section through mass with closest blue inked anterior-superior resection margin and closest skin, A4 closest green-inked anterior-inferior margin, A5-A6 remainder of mass, A7 nodular fibrous tissue adjacent to mass, A8 soft and friable tissue deep to nipple, A9 representative upper-outer quadrant, A10 representative lower-outer quadrant, A11 representative upper-inner quadrant, A12 representative lower-inner quadrant.\nJF/cs  **DATE[May 22 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nSections examined.  Immunohistochemistry stains were performed to evaluate for myoepithelial cells.

Submitted fresh and designated \\\"right lung mass\\\" are 2 very hemorrhagic reddish-brown biopsy specimens that are submitted for frozen sections and are now entirely submitted in cassette A. B. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"right lung mass for bronchial margins\\\", the specimen consists of a lung lobectomy specimen with staple lines present. The specimen measures up to approximately 12 x 8 x 4 cm in greatest dimensions. The staple line is partially interrupted revealing bronchial margins. The bronchial margins are submitted for frozen sections and are now submitted in cassette B1. The additional lung tissue is then perfused prior to examination. Additional stapled tissue is removed prior to further examination. The pleural surface shows a roughly sutured area measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension which probably represents the prior biopsy site. Possible anthracotic peribronchial lymph node structures are identified and submitted in cassette B2. Also submitted in cassette B2 are probable vascular margins of excision. The specimen is sectioned with possible pulmonary edema identified; 1.5 cm from the margin of excision (the pleural surface) is a 2.3 cm in greatest dimension hemorrhagic and necrotic appearing mass lesion. This area is sectioned and submitted in cassettes B3 through B6, with pleural surface also submitted.  Sections away from tumor, of possible emphysematous and edematous tissue, are submitted in cassette B7. C. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"station 4R lymph nodes\\\", the specimen consists of hemorrhagic and anthracotic red-brown soft tissue, with the smaller portion entirely submitted in cassette C1. The larger specimen measures up to 4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. This is sectioned longitudinally and entirely submitted in cassettes C2 and C3. D: **DATE[May 28 2012] - 1637 hours T: **DATE[May 29 2012] - 0746 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION A. The sections are of lung and show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with hyperchromatic nuclei, scant eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm and focal mucoid production. B. The sections from the bronchial margin show bronchial tissue with the lung tissue surrounding the bronchus showing a moderate level of emphysematous change. No malignancy is seen. The sections from lymph nodes show anthracotic node and the blood vessel shows blood vessel with no tumor present. The multiple sections from the nodule show adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with focal lepidic spread through the lung parenchyma. Fresh hemorrhage and emphysematous change are identified in the surrounding soft tissue. The pleural surfaces are uninvolved by tumor. Emphysematous changes are noted throughout the extra sections examined. C. The section show benign adipose tissue and fibrous tissue with benign reactive anthracotic lymph node identified. No evidence of metastatic malignancy is seen.

Touch preps are made to yield the following diagnosis per the pathologist Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]:  'Evaluation episode #1 (TP #1 and 2):  Non-small cell carcinoma.'  The tissue is wrapped and submitted for permanent in A1.\nRA/cs  **DATE[Jun 17 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nThe H&E-stained sections of the lung mass biopsy show scattered nests of malignant cells on a background of fibrosis with focal necrosis.  The malignant cells show areas of gland formation and are characterized by large pleomorphic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, hyperchromatic nuclei and moderate to abundant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles.  A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed on the core biopsies on block A1 and show:\n  CK-5/6    Few scattered cells positive\n  CK-7      Positive\n  CK-20      Negative\n  Napsin-A    Positive\n  P63      Scattered cells positive\n  TTF-1      Positive\n  WT-1      Negative\nInterpretation:  The immunohistochemical stains show the malignant cells are positive for CK-7, Napsin-A, and TTF-1 with weak and focal expression of CK-5/6 and p63.  CK-20 and WT-1 are negative.  The morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jun 19 12]\n\n<INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT>\n\n<FINAL DX>\nLUNG MASS, CT-GUIDED BIOPSY:\n  NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH ADENOCARCINOMA OF \n    PULMONARY ORIGIN.\n\n<DX COMMENT>\nEGFR studies are pending and results will be reported in an addendum.

The specimen is received in fixative and consists of an unopened 27 cm segment of bowel with a moderate amount of attached pericolonic fat.  A surgical glove is attached to the proximal aspect of the specimen.  The serosa is pink and has dense adhesions.  The proximal margin is closed with a staple line and measures 4.7 cm in circumference.  The distal margin surrounded with anal mucosa is sutured shut and measures 8 cm in circumference.  A 0.5 x 0.3 cm ill-defined slightly invaginated area is located 4.5 cm from the distal surgical margin and 1.2 cm from the dentate line.  The tissue subjacent to this area is cauterized.  The invaginated area does not appear to extend into the bowel wall.  The radial margin is located approximately 0.3 cm from the bowel.  Dilated blood-filled submucosal vessels are present between the dentate line and the distal surgical margin.  A 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm red polypoid structure is located 8 cm from the proximal surgical margin.  The polyp moves with ease over the muscularis. Additionally received in the same container is a 2 x 2 x 0.9 cm annular piece of tissue partially covered with mucosa.  There is a small amount of attached fat.  One margin is closed with a staple line.  No discrete mass lesions are present. Additionally received in the same container is a 2.5 x 1.5 cm ellipse of tan skin excised to a depth of 2.5 cm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1 - perpendicular proximal margin; 2 - perpendicular distal margin; 3 and 4 - entire invaginated area; 5 - dilated blood-filled vessels; 6 - polyp; 7 - annular piece of tissue; 8 - separately received piece of skin and underlying soft tissue; 9 through 11 - multiple lymph nodes. JMM:jck\nMicroscopic Description: Sections show focal residual adenocarcinoma, present within the submucosal at its deepest point, and demonstrating features consistent with therapy effect.  There is no significant extracellular mucin production.  The focus of residual tumor measures less than 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.

Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section labeled left upper lobe and consists of the aforementioned. The pleural surface is smooth and tan pink to tan purple with an area of tan white pleural thickening with puckering.  The area of pleural thickening with puckering measures 7.5 x 6.5 cm.  Cut surface shows a tan white fairly circumscribed mass with large areas of necrosis, measurements below.  The uninvolved lung parenchyma is tan red. The bronchi and airways are involved by tumor 0.5 cm away from bronchial margin.  The airways are unremarkable.  No post-obstructive changes are noted.  The remaining tissue is grossly unremarkable. Ink Code: pleura black. Measurements: Dimensions of specimen:  14 x 9 x 3 cm Specimen weight:  250 gm Mass size: 8 x 7.5 x 4 cm  Mass to pleura distance: abuts the pleural surface with puckering  Mass to bronchial margin: 0.5 cm  Length of staple line(s):  4.5 cm and 3 cm  Number of candidate hilar lymph nodes:  1 (1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) Sections: A1:  FS1A resubmitted (bronchial margin) A2:  FS1B resubmitted (mass) A3-4:  tumor with closest to pleural surface and pleural puckering A5:  mass filling the main bronchus A6:  mass with bronchus and branches of pulmonary vessels A7:  tumor additional sections A8:  vascular margin A9:  tumor additional section with branches of pulmonary vessels A10:  uninvolved lung, representative Specimen B is received in formalin labeled inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node and consists of a single fragment of dark red to dark gray soft tissue measuring 1 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.  Entire specimen submitted in cassette B1. Specimen C is received in formalin labeled interlobar lymph node and consists of two fragments of tan red to tan gray soft tissue measuring 0.9 and 1 cm in greatest dimension.  One fragment is inked black.  Both fragments are bisected and submitted entirely in cassette C1. Specimen D is received in formalin labeled anterior hilar lymphatic tissue and consists of an irregular fragment of tan red to tan brown soft tissue measuring 3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm.  Entire specimen submitted in cassette D1. Specimen E is received in formalin labeled subcarinal lymph node and consists of three fragments of tan pink to tan red soft tissue measuring, in aggregate, 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm.  The largest fragment measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.  Five possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 1 cm in greatest dimension.  All five lymph nodes are submitted in cassette E1, not modified. Specimen F is received in formalin labeled peribronchial lymph node and consists of a fragment of tan pink to tan gray soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm.  Entire specimen submitted in cassette F1. Specimen G is received fresh and inflated with formalin labeled left lower lobe completion pneumonectomy and consists of the aforementioned.

Signed  __________(signature on file)_ **NAME[ZZZ,YYY] XXX] MD  **DATE[Nov 07 11]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION Part A: Received in a formalin container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and designated as \"mid ascending colon polyp\" includes multiple fragments of tan-pink to red-tan tissue with the single largest biopsy fragment measuring 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The remaining fragments measure 1 to 3 mm in greatest dimension. This specimen is submitted in toto in block A. Part B: Received in a formalin container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and designated as \"mucosal elevation/rectal polyp\" includes 2 polypoid fragments both of which are red-brown and measure 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in block B. D: **DATE[Nov 06 2011] - 1354 hours T: **DATE[Nov 06 2011] - 1554 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION Part A: Sections of the submitted mid ascending colon polyp reveal adenomatous changes of the surface mucosal tissue with relative preservation of the colonic crypt contours.  There is a mild glandular atypia.  High-grade atypia or malignancy is not seen. Part B: Sections of the biopsy of rectal polyp reveal a fragment of acutely inflamed granulation tissue.  The second biopsy fragment also displays ulceration, acute inflammation, and granulation tissue proliferation. However, there is a proliferation of atypical squamous epithelial cells with associated parakeratosis. Thee are round edged nests extending from the surface mucosa which appear to be carcinoma in situ. These squamous cells display a marked epithelial atypia and display a marked increase in mitotic activity with 7 and 8 mitotic figures in a single high-powered field. There is also one focus in which there appears to be submucosal invasion with small irregular nests separate from the overlying malignant surface epithelium.  Lymphatic invasion is not seen. Glandular differentiation is not seen.

B)  Left breast:  Infiltrating duct carcinoma, moderately differentiated, 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm, EBR score 3+3+1=7, without lymphvascular invasion.  Duct carcinoma in situ component, intermediate grade, cribriform type with central comedonecrosis.  Multiple radial scars, papillomatosis, stromal fibrosis, and marked sclerosing adenosis with luminal microcalcifications in remainder of breast parenchyma. Benign nipple.  Benign deep soft tissue resection margin.\nGross Description: A)  Received fresh designated \"left sentinel node\" is a 2.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue, within which is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm pink-tan nodule.  The nodule is bisected, touch prepped, and submitted entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now re-submitted for permanents in cassette A-FSC. B)  Received in formalin designated \"left breast\" is a 588 gm, 20 x 20 x 4 cm total mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by a 10.5 x 6 cm pink-tan skin ellipse.  There is a central 2.5 cm in diameter areola with a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm slightly retracted black inverted nipple.  The epidermal surface is notable for a 0.2 cm prior biopsy site at the 9-10 o'clock position, 4 cm from the center of the nipple.  There is no orientation provided, thus the aspect of the specimen with the larger flap of fibro-fatty tissue will be designated superior.  The posterior surface of the specimen is inked blue. Sectioning the specimen reveals a 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm biopsy cavity within the upper inner quadrant at the 11:00 o'clock position.  The biopsy cavity is packed with white pebble-like biopsy seed material.  The biopsy cavity is 0.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The biopsy cavity is surrounded by punctate foci of hemorrhage and fat necrosis, as well as a very ill-defined area of indurated dense white-tan fibrous breast tissue.  The indurated fibrous tissue surrounding the biopsy site measures approximately 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  There is also a small amount of indurated slightly granular fibrous tissue noted extending superiorly from the biopsy site.  There are no distinct well-circumscribed masses seen.  There are no other lesional areas identified.  The remainder of the specimen is notable for a moderate amount of dense white-tan fibrous breast tissue and multiple blue-domed cystic structures.  There are no lymph nodes identified.  Representative sections are submitted and placed in formalin at 1430 hours on **DATE[Jun 29 12]. Summary of sections:  B1 - nipple base and remainder of nipple; B2-B9 - biopsy site entirely submitted, lateral to medial to include the deep margin in cassettes B4 and B5; B10\\T\\B11 - representative sections of granular fibrous tissue extending superiorly from biopsy site; B12 - random upper outer quadrant; B13 - random lower outer quadrant; B14 - random lower inner quadrant.  JAB:jlj\nMicroscopic Description: A)  The lymph node shows a normal architecture and an intact capsule. There are mild reactive changes but no evidence of primary or metastatic neoplasm. B)  Numerous sections from around the circumference of the biopsy site reveal very complicated radial scars with complex papillomatosis.  In the center of this area, there is both an intraductal and infiltrating duct carcinoma present.  The intraductal component which makes up approximately 50% of the tumor shows very large duct structures distended by atypical epithelial cells in very complicated cribriform-type patterns with central areas of eosinophilic comedonecrosis.  The invasive portion of the tumor shows small fairly solid aggregates of epithelial cells with focal lumen formations but without well-formed tubular structures present.  These cells show small to moderate amounts of cytoplasm and contain nuclei which vary markedly from small and pyknotic up to giant vesicular nuclei with variably prominent nucleoli.  Occasional mitoses can be identified averaging 2 per 10 high-power fields.  These microscopic findings would score a 3 for tubule formation, 3 for nuclear pleomorphism, and 1 for mitotic count for a combined EBR score of 7, which is moderately differentiated. No definite lymphvascular invasion can be identified.  The neoplasm shows numerous microcalcifications.  An immunoperoxidase stain for e-cadherin reveals marked cytoplasmic positivity of the invasive neoplastic cells indicative of ductal origin.  The uninvolved breast tissue shows a localized area of stromal fibrosis in association with focal papillomatosis and fairly extensive sclerosing adenosis with numerous luminal microcalcifications.  The deep soft tissue resection margin is free by approximately 0.6 cm from the deeper most aspect of the biopsy site scar.  The nipple is unremarkable.

ER clone SP1 PR clone 1E2. Scoring Guide:  A positive result is based specifically upon positive nuclear staining within tumor cells, with an intensity graded from weak-mild to strong as noted above.  If the count is greater than 0% by IHC manual morphometry, of any intensity, the result is considered POSITIVE, with only 0% staining considered NEGATIVE. HER-2/neu Status (semiquantitative):  0; Negative Method and Interpretation Guide for HER-2/neu (C-erB-2): Performed upon routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue (subject to false-negative results with improper and/or delayed fixation). Specimen identification: -    CASE #:  5227            BLOCK #:  B4 -    Specimen site and type:  Left mastectomy -    Time to fixation:  45 minutes -    Duration of fixation:  7 hours HER-2/neu clone 4B5. Method used:  VENTANA i VIEW PATHWAYS (FDA approved, controls high protein expression, low level protein expression, negative protein expression, internal). Adequacy of sample for evaluation:  Adequate Result interpretation:  Negative Percentage of invasive tumor cells exhibiting complete membrane staining:  0% Uniformity of staining present or absent:  Absent Homogeneous dark circumferential pattern present or absent:  Absent Scoring Guide: Staining Pattern                   Result      0    No membrane staining observed      Negative           (or membrane staining observed           in a count of less than 10% of tumor cells).      1+   Faint/partial membrane staining         Negative           (detected in a count of more than 10% of           tumor cells.  Staining may not           encircle entire cell membrane).      2+   Weak complete membrane staining,        Equivocal           observed in a count of more than 10% of tumor cells (encircling entire cell membrane).      3+   Moderate to strong (intense) complete   Positive           membrane staining observed in a count of more than 10% of tumor cells (encircling           entire cell membrane). NOTE:  The immunohistochemical methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor status are considered semiquantitative with results expressed as detailed above.   Despite an FDA approved scoring guide that classifies 2+ immunohistochemistry results as equivocal, the literature suggests that up to 70% of these cases may be actually the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative.  As such, a reflex to HER-2/neu FISH testing could be considered before administration of Herceptin therapy.  The immunohistochemistry methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor and HER-2/neu status are considered semiquantitative, with results expressed as detailed above.  These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology Department.  This laboratory is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88), as qualified to perform high complexity testing. **NAME[YYY XXX:  WWW M VVV] MD Pathologist Electronically Signed **DATE[Jun 31 2012]\nSpecimen Source:   APSURG\\T\\AP SURGICAL SPECIMEN\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\OTHR\\T\\Miscellaneous   SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: A Left sentinal node SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: B Left breast\n"

On three of the core biopsies, in areas of dense\nfibrosis, there are nests of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. The\npresence of these epithelial cells is confirmed with an immunostain for\npancytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Invasive tumor spans a greatest area of up to\n2.8 mm on a single core. \nSlides from the previous breast cancer are not in our files for a direct\nhistologic comparison but given the location within scar tissues and the\nadjacent fat necrosis this is likely near the site of a previous surgical\nprocedure and could be recurrent tumor. The possibility of a new primary\ncarcinoma arising at this site can not be completely excluded. \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC) REPORT:\nANTIBODIES:RESULTS: \n1. HER2-NEU (4B5): PENDING\n2.

It arises from a tubular adenoma and invades into the submucosa.  Two lymph nodes are positive (2/25).  Medullary carcinoma is a distinctive histologic type strongly associated with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), indicative of defects in the normal DNA repair gene function.  MSI testing is generally recommended in cases that show the MSI-H phenotype.\n\nSpecimen signed out at **STREET-ADDRESS, **PLACE, HI  **ZIP-CODE. |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right colon\" is a segment of small bowel (3 cm in length by 2 cm in diameter) and a segment of large bowel (18 cm in length by 3 cm in diameter).  A smooth pink-tan appendix (8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm) is attached to the cecum of the large bowel.  Both proximal and distal resection margins are inked black and the radial resection margin is inked green.  \n\nThe specimen is opened to reveal a tan-red mass (2.5 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm) which is found in the cecum at the appendiceal orifice.  The mass is grossly located 4 cm away from the proximal resection margin, 16.5 cm away from the distal resection margin and 6 cm away from the radial resection margin.  The mass does not grossly appear to penetrate through the muscularis propria.  \n\nAlso found in the large bowel are two possible polyps measuring 0.2 and 0.4 cm in greatest dimension and found 9 cm and 6 cm away from the distal resection margin respectively.  \n\nThe remainder of the specimen appears grossly normal.  \n\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock summary:\n1.  -  Perpendicular section of proximal resection margin.\n2.  -  Perpendicular section of distal resection margin.\n3.  -  En face section of radial resection margin.\n4.  -  Cross section of proximal end of appendix.\n5.  -  Additional cross sections of appendix.\n6.  -  Distal tip of appendix.\n7-9.  -  Sections of mass, entirely submitted.\n10.  -  Two possible polyps.\n11.  -  Section of ileocecal valve.\n12.  -  Sections of small bowel.\n13-14.  -  Sections of large bowel.\n15.  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n16.  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n17.  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\n18.  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n19.  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right colon\n"

        "doc_raw_text": "PART / DESCRIPTION - SEQ \nBREAST,,MASTECTOMY WITH NODES/ RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS- A\nINTRAOPERATIVE DX:\nNONE\nDIAGNOSIS COMMENTS:\nThe clinical impression of a possible satellite nodule is noted. Sampling of the presumed area shows marked lymphocytic lobulitis. Although it is of some interest that the in-situ and the invasive carcinoma are accompanied by marked lymphocytic infiltrate, the lobules in the presumed area of satellite nodule do not exhibit convincing cytomorphologic or histoarchitectural features of carcinoma (or atypical ductal hyperplasia), although some reactive changes are appreciated. \n\nThe larger positive node was extensively sampled to evaluate for extranodal extension. It is extensively replaced by carcinoma which for the most part appears surrounded by dense fibrosis In one area (A20), this fibrosis is much more abundant, appears eccentric, contains a nest of carcinoma, as well as possible entrapped adipocytes; these features are interpreted as extranodal extension.\nFINAL DX:\n\nBreast and axillary contents, right, mastectomy with axillary dissection: Infiltrating carcinoma with the following features:  Histologic type:   Ductal.\nSize:     4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm.  Histologic grade:   High, G3 of 3.  Nottingham grade:   9 of 9.   Tubule formation:    Poor (3 of 3).   Nuclear grade:   High (3 of 3).   Mitotic rate:    High (3 of 3).  Lymph-vascular invasion:  Identified, focal. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with the following features:  Histologic type:   Solid.  Nuclear grade:    High.  Necrosis:    Present.  Calcifications:    Rare.  Estimated size/extent of DCIS: Rare ducts with DCIS are seen in association with infiltrating        carcinoma.      Separate incidental microscopic focus of DCIS with features      similar to those reported above, identified in upper inner      quadrant at 3 cm medial and superior from main mass.\nExtensive intraductal component: Not identified. Surgical margins:  Infiltrating carcinoma:   Widely free (distance greater than 1 cm, all margins).  Ductal carcinoma in situ:   Widely free (distance greater than 1 cm, all margins). Lymph nodes:    Twenty-five lymph nodes identified.         Two lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (2/25).         Largest metastatic deposit: 3.5 cm.         Focal features consistent with extranodal extension identified. Pathologic stage:   pT2, pN1a (AJCC 7th edition). Additional findings:      Immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her-2/neu overexpression have previously been performed (as per report ***PATH-NUMBER[1], slides not concurrently reviewed), with the following results: ER positive, 100% of tumor cell nuclei with strong staining, PR positive, 20-25% of tumor cell nuclei with moderate to strong staining, HER-2/neu equivocal by immunohistochemistry (score of 2+), negative for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH.    Nipple and skin with focal changes consistent with involvement by carcinoma at the base of the    nipple and at the deepest parts of the dermis of skin.    Two hemangiomas of skin, up to 0.4 cm.    Previous biopsy site with associated changes.    Striated muscle with no histologic abnormality is seen in some of the samples from the deep margin.\nMICROSCOPIC:\nUnless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen is based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.GROSS:\nReceived fresh, labeled ''**NAME[BBB, CCC]' and designated ''right breast and axillary contents'', is an 1178-g right breast with the letter R and an arrow pointing toward axilla written on the skin with an attached 9 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm axillary tail. It has dimensions as follows: medial to lateral - 23 cm, superior to inferior - 25 cm superficial to deep - 5.5 cm. There is a 20 x 13.5 cm ellipse of skin with a 1 cm, retracted nipple. There are two, 0.4 cm in diameter, red-brown macules within the 5 and 7 o'clock skin regions, respectively, and coming to within 0.3 cm of the nearest skin margin. The specimen is inked as follows: superior superficial - orange, inferior superficial- blue, deep - black. The breast is sectioned from medial to lateral into 30 slices, numbered respectively (nipple between slices 11-12). There is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm firm white mass in slices 11-14, 4 cm from the deep margin, 4 cm from the superior superficial margin, 7 cm from the inferior superficial margin, 4 cm from the nearest skin margin, and 0.3 cm from the nipple. The remainder of the specimen consists of 90% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 10% white fibrous tissue. There are 26 possible lymph nodes and one grossly positive lymph node identified within the axillary tail, up to 3.5 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - nipple, bisected and subareolar tissue; A2 - slice 10, area immediately medial to mass with separate superficial and deep; A3 - slice 11, mass with attached overlying skin and separate deep; A4 - slice 12, representative section of mass with attached subareolar tissue and skin near nipple and separate deep; A5-A6 - slice 13, mass with separate superficial and deep; A7 - slice 14, mass, with separate superficial and deep; A8 - slice 15, area immediately lateral to mass, with separate superficial and deep; A9 - slice 18, upper outer quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A10 - slice 22, lower outer quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A11 - slice 8, lower inner quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A12 - slice 6, upper inner quadrant, with separate superficial and deep (3 cm medial and superior to mass, 1.5 cm from the deep margin, 2.5 cm from the superior superficial margin, 8 cm from the inferior superficial margin, 2.5 cm from the nearest skin margin, and 3.3 cm from the nipple); A13 - six possible axillary lymph nodes; A14 - six possible axillary lymph nodes; A15 - five possible axillary lymph nodes; A16 - four possible axillary lymph nodes; A17 - two possible axillary lymph nodes; A18 - two possible axillary lymph nodes; A19 - one possible axillary lymph node, serially sectioned; A20 - representative sections of grossly positive lymph node; A21 - slice 5, upper inner quadrant, directly medial to section from cassette A12, with separate superficial and deep; A22 - slice 7, immediately lateral to section from cassette A12, with separate superficial and deep; A23 - slice 16, possible satellite nodule; A24 - slice 17, possible satellite nodule; A25 - slice 15, possible satellite nodule; A26-A27 - representative additional sections of grossly positive lymph node; A28 - representative sections of skin macules. Specimen was put into formalin at approximately 4 p.m. on **DATE[Feb 02 2012] and will have a total time in formalin of 20-1/2 hours.

Metaplastic carcinoma, intermediate grade, spindle cell type (1.9 cm greatest diameter measured histologically).       B.     Tumor abuts against inked surgical margins of the biopsy specimen.       C.     Central areas of sclerotic scar and entrapped degenerating adipose tissue consistent with remote radiation effect.   Comment:    This case was reviewed at the **INSTITUTION **INSTITUTION Breast Pathology section  by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY].  The above diagnosis reflects her consultative opinion.  The complete report from  **INSTITUTION is appended below.                      1  Electronically Signed Out By Ben **NAME[M. XXX], MD Results {Not Entered} Interpretation-Comments {Not Entered}\nGross Description Specimen #1 is received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name and designated \"right breast biopsy.\"  The specimen consists of a fatty tissue fragment measuring 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.0 cm.  The external surface is soft and lobulated.  The external surface is inked black.  The cut surface reveals a well-defined yellow-gray firm mass measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm.  The mass abuts the resection margin.  The remaining breast tissue is yellow-pink, soft and fatty.  A representative section of the mass is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in (block A).  The remaining mass submitted in (blocks B through D).  A representative section of unremarkable breast tissue is submitted in (block E).  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of right breast biopsy reveal a relatively well-delineated nodular lesion demonstrating a central area of sclerosis, scarring and entrapped degenerating adipose tissue.  This area was represented primarily in frozen section samples.  Adjacent to and peripheral to this area are foci of a spindle cell proliferation showing a much higher cellularity.  The spindle cells are arranged in a haphazard fashion with occasional formation of sheets and fascicles.  Nuclei are elongated and demonstrate a slight increase in density of chromatin.  Significant numbers of mitotic figures are observed.  The tumor abuts against the inked surgical margin of excision of the biopsy.   This case was sent in consultation to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] at **NAME[WWW] University **INSTITUTION who feels that this lesion represents a metaplastic carcinoma of intermediate grade, spindle cell type.  The malignant cells express p63, and Cytokeratins CK5/6, AE1/AE3 and are CK903 positive, which are findings characteristic of metaplastic carcinomas.

B)  Left thyroid lobe, lobectomy:  Multifocal papillary carcinoma ( largest focus 1.1 x 0.3 cm), in a background of hyperplastic thyroid, consistent with Grave's disease with patchy lymphocytic thyroiditis.\nGross Description: Two containers. A)  Container A is labeled \\\"right thyroid lobe\\\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 24 gram, 7 x 4 x 3 cm lobulated lobe of thyroid.  The specimen is inked.  A 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm nodule is attached to the edge of the thyroid lobe.  The cut surface is deep red and has a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm white nodule.  The remaining cut surface has no discrete mass lesions.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - entire nodule attached to the thyroid gland; A2 - entire small white nodule; A3 through A8 - representative sections. B)  Specimen B is labeled \\\"left thyroid lobe\\\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 23 gram, 6.5 x 4 x 3 cm lobulated tan-gray lobe of thyroid.  The specimen is inked.  The cut surface is vaguely nodular and ranges from pink to red.  A single 0.4 cm solid white nodule is present.  No additional mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 - entire nodule; B2 through B6 - random sections of thyroid. JMM:jck\nMicroscopic Description: A \\T\\ B)  Right and left lobes, lobectomies:  Sections from both thyroid lobes reveal similar findings demonstrating numerous thyroid follicles of varying sizes and shapes containing varying amounts of colloid. Patchy areas of lymphoid aggregates are noted, consistent with focal lymphocytic thyroiditis.  There are small Hurthle cell nodules noted also.  Some of the follicles demonstrate pseudopapillary projections within the follicles.  However, additionally, there are several foci of demonstrating nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma with enlarged, hypochromatic nuclei with occasional nuclear grooves, nuclear overlapping, and an occasional intranuclear inclusion.  Two benign lymph nodes are noted.  For further details, see case summary below. CASE SUMMARY FOR PRIMARY CARCINOMA OF THE THYROID Procedure:  Right and left thyroid lobectomies. Specimen size:  Right - 24 grams, 7 x 4 x 3 cm; left - 23 grams, 6.5 x 4 x 3 cm. Specimen integrity: Each separate lobe is intact. Tumor focality:  Multifocal, bilateral. Location of tumor(s):  Right and left lobes. Tumor size:  Largest focus 1.1 x 0.3 cm. Histologic type:  Papillary carcinoma, classic and follicular variant. Histologic grade: Well differentiated Tumor encapsulation:  None. Tumor capsule invasion:  Cannot be assessed. Lymph-vascular invasion:  Not identified. Extrathyroidal extension:  Not identified. Margins:  Negative for malignancy. Lymph nodes:  No lymph nodes identified. Additional pathologic findings:  Diffuse thyroid hyperplasia (consistent with Grave's disease), lymphocytic thyroiditis.

Lymph Node, Right Axillary Lymph Node, Biopsy:\nInvasive Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Identical to That Seen in Part #1, Present in One (1) Core (No Lymph Node Tissue).\nTwo (2) Other Core Biopsy Fragments of Lymph Node Without Evidence of Metastatic Carcinoma; Clinical Correlation Recommended. \n\nCOMMENT: \n  This case is reviewed at the Daily Departmental Conference. Receptor studies pending and results will follow as an addendum.\nGrossDescription:\n  Container 1:  Received in formalin labeled right breast biopsy 12 o?clock per the container and right breast biopsy 12 o?clock 2.0cm from nipple per the requisition are three cylindrical portions of tan to pink, soft tissue ranging from 0.4 x 0.1cm to 1.8 x 0.2cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 1A.\n\n  Container 2:  Received in formalin labeled right axilla lymph node are three cylindrical portions of tan to pink, soft tissue ranging from 0.8 x 0.2cm to 1.5 x 0.2cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 2A.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nAC:lefb **DATE[Mar 4 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Right breast core biopsy2: Right lymph node core biopsy\nAddendumComment:\nER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)\nEstrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: \nDeparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls.  Localization is via a biotin free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody.  The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR CLONE 6F11) is negative in >99% of the tumor cells.  The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO Clone PgR 636) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells.  The Herceptest (DAKO) shows 2+ indeterminate staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0 to 3+ scale.  FISH for Her2neu will be performed.\n\nNOTE:   Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.  Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO CAP scoring criteria.  If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nNOTE:   ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3).  Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1).  Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.  \n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F\n\n"

The findings are certainly histologically compatible with a\nprimary lung squamous cell carcinoma.

Received in formalin designated \\\"solitary pulmonary nodule right upper lung lobe\\\" is a wedge biopsy of tan-pink to dark red pulmonary parenchyma which weighs 24 grams and measures 6 x 5 x 3 cm.  There is a palpable nodule within the specimen.  The overlying pleura is puckered.  This region is inked with black ink.  The staple lines are removed, and the   PATHOLOGY REPORT   \\T\\a9.3L   GROSS DESCRIPTION          (Continued)   underlying parenchyma is dark red to light tan with black reticulations.  No tumor is visible at the parenchymal margin.  The parenchymal margins are submitted in blocks A1-A2. The specimen is sectioned showing a tan-white tumor with foci of black discoloration.  It measures 2.2 x 2 x 1.8 cm.  The tumor approaches the pleural surface within less than 0.1 cm.  Sections of the tumor are submitted in A3-A5.  The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy dark red with black reticulations.  Representative sections are submitted in block A6.   B.  Received in formalin designated \\\"inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node\\\" is a gray-black lymph node with a small amount of attached adipose tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.  It is entirely submitted in B.   C.  Received in formalin designated \\\"level 4R lymph node\\\" are multiple fragments of gray-black lymph node with a small amount of attached adipose tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. in aggregate.  The specimen is entirely submitted in block C.   D.  Received in formalin designated \\\"level 7 lymph node\\\" is a gray-black lymph node which measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and has a homogeneous jet-black cut surface.  It is entirely submitted in block D. \nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION   A.  Sections of the tumor show an invasive non-small cell carcinoma.  Centrally, there is a scar.  The tumor shows glandular differentiation throughout much of its volume with areas of bronchoalveolar carcinoma-like growth at its periphery.  Centrally, there is a desmoplasatic response.  There are also areas in which the tumor infiltrates in solid nests and in fused glandular arrays.  Tumor cells have large nuclei with prominent nucleoli.  PAS stains with and without diastase confirm mucin production in tumor cells.  At the pleural surface, there is mild fibrosis and chronic inflammation with retraction of the pleura, but invasion of the pleura is not seen on elastin stains (x3, blocks A3-A5).  Immunohistochemical stains are completed with adequate positive and negative controls in an attempt to further define tumor origin.  Tumor cells show diffuse strong staining for cytokeratin 7.  They are negative for cytokeratin 20.  A TTF-1 stain shows diffuse moderate to strong nuclear staining of tumor cells.  Tumor cells are also positive for estrogen receptor.   B-D.

The overall features are not those of a conventional colonic adenocarcinoma.  Though a primary colonic carcinoma remains a consideration, metastatic carcinoma and other non-epithelial malignancies (including GIST) are a consideration.  Case discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Sep 12 2012] and **DATE[Sep 13 2012].\n\nThe following stains were performed in the evaluation of this case (see microscopic description for complete details): vimentin, cytokeratin 8/18, EMA, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, DOG1, CD45, S100, CDX2, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, ER, PR, GCDFP15, mammaglobin, PAX2, PAX8, WT1, CA125, p63, cytokeratin 5/6, CD138, CD43, TTF1, thyroglobulin, HMB45, melan-A, CD30, desmin, CD117, PASD.\nGrossDescription:\nSpecimen:  Soft tan tissue.\nNumber of segments:  Multiple.    \nSize:  Up to 0.3 cm.\nSubmitted for microscopic evaluation:  All.    \nCassettes:  1.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe biopsy consists of multiple fragments of colonic mucosa, some involved by a proliferation/infiltrate a poorly differentiated epithelioid cells.  In areas, a rhabdoid morphology is noted.  No associated in situ lesion (ie. adenoma) is identified.\n\nImmunoreactivity is noted with vimentin and focal immunoreactivity is identified on cytokeratin 8/18, EMA, cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and DOG1 (weak) stained sections.  CD45, S100, CDX2, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, ER, PR, GCDFP15, mammaglobin, PAX2, PAX8, WT1, CA125, p63, cytokeratin 5/6, CD138, CD43, TTF1, thyroglobulin, HMB45, melan-A, CD30, desmin and CD117 are noted.

The specimen consists of six yellow-pink to gray soft tissue core biopsies measuring up to 4 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. The cores appear predominantly fatty with focal areas of pink-gray fibrous tissue measuring up to 0.6 cm in dimension.  A radiograph does not accompany the specimen.  The cores are totally submitted in (blocks A-C). **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of needle core biopsies of left breast mass reveal at least partial involvement of all biopsy cylinders by an infiltrating ductal carcinoma (grade 2).  The tumor demonstrates no significant tubule formation and malignant ductal epithelial cells are arranged in rounded nests, narrow ribbons, and irregular clusters.  There is subtle infiltration of adjacent adipose tissue with most areas of tumor demonstrating a dense sclerotic and focally elastotic fibrous stroma.  Tumor nuclei are moderately enlarged with distinct round nucleoli and some show vesiculation of nuclear chromatin.  Tumor demonstrates a low mitotic index with an average of two mitoses observed per 10 high power fields.  There is no distinct angiolymphatic invasion by tumor identified.  Maximum linear diameter of any focus of tumor is 1.4 cm.

CONSULTANT's DIAGNOSIS: COLON POLYP AT THE ILEOCECAL VALVE:  Superficial fragments of at least intramucosal adenocarcinoma, see microscopic description and comment on outside report. (The consultant recommended complete excision of this lesion to exclude the possibility of a frankly invasive neoplasm.)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION The specimen is labeled \"ileocecal valve biospy\" and consists of three fragments of tan mucosa measuring 0.3 cm each. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 1.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Sections show colonic mucosa with polypoid formation present.  Tubular adenoma with medium-grade dysplasia is present.  Deeper sections show tubular adenoma with focal high-grade dysplasia. Deeper sections show adenocarcinoma with invasive features noted. <Sign Out Dr. **NAME[XXX]> **NAME[WWW VVV], M.D, PATHOLOGIST Page 1 of 1\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  COLON BIOPSY, SURGICAL BIOPSY Ileocecal valve biopsy\n"

The findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Feb 7 2012]. |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived fresh labeled \"left breast mass\" is an oriented breast mass excision specimen measuring 8 x 5 x 2 cm.  The specimen is demarcated with margin markers and inked as follows:  medial - red, caudal - green, cranial - blue, skin - orange, lateral - violet, and deep - black.  Sections reveal a centralized hemorrhagic cavity filled with approximately 10 - 20 ccs of blood.  The lining of the cavity is tan-yellow, pink and smooth with no excrescences.  The outlying tissue is predominantly tan-yellow, fibro-fatty breast parenchyma with no circumscribed lesions or masses noted grossly.  The cavity wall is within 0.3 cm of the nearest cranial margin and more than 0.5 cm from all other margins.  The cavity appears to have no definite involvement of the resection margin.  Representative sections are submitted from medial to lateral in sixteen cassettes with the medial most aspect in cassette 1, lateral most aspect in cassette 12, and mostly representative sections of hemorrhagic cyst in cassettes 2 - 15.  The specimen was collected on **DATE[Feb 5 12] at 10:23 a.m. and placed in formalin at 11:00 a.m. for a fixation time of 7 hours.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nConfirmed.\nA: Left breast mass\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nPROGNOSTIC PANEL SUMMARY\n\n\nEstrogen receptor (clone 1D5):    Negative\nProgesterone receptor (clone PgR 636):  Negative\nHER-2/neu (HercepTest):      Negative for overexpression\nKi-67 (clone Ki-S5):      Elevated cell proliferation\np53 (clone DO7):        Normal\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, see image analysis report for complete analytic results.\nAddendumComment:\nImmunohistochemical stains p63, myosin heavy chain and E-cadherin are performed and support the diagnosis.\n"

Once received, her consultative report will be issued as an addendum to this report\n\nCase reviewed in Pathology Staff Conference on **DATE[Feb 16 12] and **DATE[Feb 21 12].  The findings were discussed with **NAME[XXX WWW], PA-C on **DATE[Feb 21 12] at 3:41 a.m./r/n\nGrossDescription:\nLabeled:      Patient name and medical record number, designated right anterior thigh\nSpecimen:    0.5 x 0.5 cm excised to a depth of 0.4 cm punch biopsy (formalin)\nLesion:      Ill-defined 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm pale gray focus present at the margin\nSubmitted/Block:    Entirely bisected/1./r/n\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe H\\T\\E-stained sections demonstrate an atypical dermal infiltrate comprised of widely scattered large atypical lymphoid cells admixed with small, mature lymphocytes, scattered histiocytes, and rare eosinophils. The atypical cells have abundant cytoplasm and nuclei with irregular contours, pale chromatin, and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli.  \n\nTo further investigate, immunohistochemical stains are performed on sections from block A1 with appropriately staining positive and negative controls.  The large atypical lymphoid cells are positive for CD30 (membranous and Golgi-staining patterns), CD15 (membranous and Golgi-staining patterns), PAX-5 (dim), and CD20 (membranous).  They are negative for BCL6, BCL2, CD10, CD45, EMA, CD3, and CD5.  No significant staining with CD21 is identified.  The interspersed small lymphocytes are a mixture of CD20-positive B-cells and CD3-positive T-cells (with a subset co-expressing CD5)./r/n\nA: Right anterior thigh, punch biopsy\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nSkin, right anterior thigh, punch biopsy (**PLACE, HI, ***PATH-NUMBER[1], **DATE[Feb 14 2012]):\n        Atypical lymphoid proliferation (see Note)./r/nAddendumComment:\nThe following results were performed at **INSTITUTION Department of Pathology and reported by \n**NAME[ZZZ YYY], M.D. on **DATE[Mar 13 2012].  The results were discussed with **NAME[EEE WWW] on **DATE[Mar 19 12] at 10:15 a.m.\n\n\nNote:  We agree that the histologic appearance of the dermal infiltrate is highly suggestive of cutaneous involvement by classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL).  However, there are a number of features that prevent us from making a definitive diagnosis.  Both the site and the clinical history are extremely unusual for CHL, but the major impediment to establishing a definitive diagnosis is that the immunophenotype is also not completely characteristic.  All of the large cells show strong CD20 and PAX5-positivity, as well as some CD45 positivity.  CD30 staining is positive but somewhat weak for CHL, and CD15 is almost completely negative.\n\nThis is an extremely challenging case.  Since there are multiple infectious/inflammatory processes that can mimic many features of CHL, in the absence of a classic immunophenotype and in conjunction with the unusual site and clinical presentation, we are unable to make a definitive diagnosis of CHL.  There are numerous small background T-cells, as well as numerous variably-sized B-cells, but, in our opinion, the atypical lymphoid infiltrate does not meet the criteria for peripheral T-cell lymphoma or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma either.  Antigen receptor PCR analyses for B-cell and T-cell clonality were performed in consideration of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and both were negative.  The case was reviewed at the **NAME[DDD FFF] Conference on **DATE[Mar 5 2012] by Drs. **NAME[VVV, UUU, TTT] and **NAME[SSS]: they concur with this interpretation.\n\nMicroscopic Description:  Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the skin punch biopsy show skin with a superficial to deep dense lymphocytic infiltrate restricted to the dermis and not involving the overlying epidermis.  Scattered large atypical cells with prominent nucleoli and cytoplasmic clearing/retraction resembling classical Hodgkin lymphoma lacunar cells are present.  The background infiltrate is composed of numerous small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical Stains:  The following immunostains were received for review from the referring institution:  CD3, CD5, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD21, CD30, CD45, BCL2, BCL6, PAX 5 and EMA.  Limited additional immunostaining were performed at OHSU, using the CD3, CD15, CD20, CD30 and PAX 5 antibodies, which showed similar staining to the outside immunostains.  The large atypical cells show the following immunophenotype:\n  CD3  negative\n  CD5  negative\n  CD10  negative\n  CD15  rare positive cells\n  CD20  strongly and homogenously positive\n  CD30  variably positive\n  CD45  variably positive\n  BCL2  negative\n  BCL6  occasional positive cell\n  PAX 5  strongly positive\n\nThe background small lymphocytes are mainly CD3 and CD5-positive T-cells, but there are also numerous, variably-sized B-cells in the infiltrate, highlighted by staining with the CD20 and PAX 5 antibodies.\n\nIn Situ Hybridization:  Molecular probes were used in an in situ hybridization analysis for **NAME[RRR QQQ] virus encoded mRNA.  Appropriate controls, including RNA controls, were performed and test validity confirmed.  The large atypical cells are negative for Epstein-Barr virus on the in situ hybridization analysis.\n\n(Analyte specific reagents are used in many laboratory tests necessary for standard medical care and generally do not require FDA approval.  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OHSU laboratories.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)./r/n\n"

Lung, Right Lower Lobe, CT-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration with Cell\nBlock Preparation:\nSquamous cell carcinoma.\n\n<COMMENT>\nThe patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and a\nsubsequent lung mass. Strong p16 staining in the lung mass favors that\nthe lung tumor represents metastatic disease, but is not definitive and\nshould be interpreted within the clinical context.  If the primary\ntongue tumor is not p16 positive, then it is likely that the lung tumor\nrepresents a synchronous malignancy.\n\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nPatient with history of  squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and a\nlung mass.\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL EVALUATION:\nA1.  Lung (core biopsy touch preps):  \"Nonsmall cell carcinoma\".\nB1. Lung (fine needle aspirate preparation):  \"Nonsmall cell carcinoma\".\nPerformed by: **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], M.D.\n\n<GROSS>\nA.  Received from Dr. **NAME[XXX] in Interventional Radiology labeled with the\npatient's name and date of birth are two cores of tan tissue (0.2 x 0.2\nx 0.1 cm and 0.2 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm), from which one air-dried touch prep\nand one alcohol-fixed touch prep are made. The air-dried touch prep is\nDiff-Quik stained and submitted for intraprocedural evaluation. The\nalcohol-fixed touch prep is Papanicolaou-stained. The biopsy tissue is\nformalin fixed and submitted for histologic processing. A1, core biopsy\nright lower lobe lung.\n\nB.  Additionally received labeled part B are one air-dried direct smear,\none alcohol direct smear and material in 10 ml of CytoLyt from the left\nlower lobe lesion. The air-dried direct smear is Diff-Quik, stained and\nsubmitted for intraprocedural evaluation. The alcohol-fixed direct smear\nis Papanicolaou-stained. The material in CytoLyt is prepared into a cell\nblock. B1, left lower lung, cell block preparation from FNA.  **INITIALS\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nUnless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen\nis based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate\ncontrols are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific\nfluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or\nall of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based\nmethod, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin\nfree multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the\ntable below:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\np16  Positive\n\nBlock B1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\np63  Positive\np16  Variably positive\n\nImpression:  p16 staining in the tumor in the cell block is variably\npositive but is strongly positive in the core biopsy material.\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M YYY] M.D.\nComment:\n\nThe immunohistochemical tests reported were developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by CellNetix Labs, LLC.  Some tests have not\nbeen cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The\nFDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nThese tests may be used for clinical purposes.  They should not be\nregarded as investigational or for research use only.

Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal\nantibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show\nappropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2\nimmunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP\nin 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nHER2 1+   Negative for overexpression\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[VVV M. UUU] MD\nComment:\n\n1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A\nscore of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane\nstaining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is\ndefined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak\nin intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least\n10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining\nbut in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2\ntest) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any\nproportion of tumor cells.\n2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by\nimmunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as\nnegative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low\nlevel HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of\ncases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the\nvast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene\namplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene\namplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be\nconsidered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive\ntesting for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all\ncases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by\nimmunohistochemistry.

These blasts are predominantly small to occasional medium sized cells with scant cytoplasm, irregular shaped nuclear contour and rare inconspicuous nucleoli.  The erythrocytes are normochromic.  Nucleated RBC s are not noted.  The platelets are normal in quantity.  \n\nBONE BIOPSY SECTION:  The bone biopsy is hypercellular.  The cellularity is approximately 80%.  Sheets of blasts are present and comprise approximately 80% of the nucleated cell population.  Immunoperoxidase stains show that these blasts express BCL-2, CD5, CD3 and TdT, similar immunophenotype as the T lymphoblasts previously seen in this patient s prior bone marrow biopsy.  The scant red-cell series is normoblastic.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is approximately 3:1.  The scant myeloid cell lines show normal maturation.  There are adequate numbers of megakaryocytes.  No granulomata, extrinsic cells, vascular lesions or parasites are seen.\n\nASPIRATION SMEARS:  The smears confirm the findings noted above.  Lymphoblasts comprise approximately 80% of the nucleated cell population.  The blasts are predominantly small to occasional medium sized cells with scant cytoplasm, irregular shaped nuclear contour and rare inconspicuous nucleoli.  The scant numbers of myeloid and erythroid precursors show no evidence of maturation arrest.  There is no evidence of dyserythropoiesis or dysmyelopoiesis.\n\nIRON STORES:  There are very scant iron stores seen in the core biopsy section and aspirate smear./r/n\nA: Bone marrow, aspiration and needle biopsy\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nBone Marrow:  Immunophenotype consistent with T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma./r/nAddendumComment:\nThe above interpretation and following results were reported by **NAME[XXX WWW], M.D. at Hawaii Pathologists  Laboratory on **DATE[Jan 06 2012].\n\nIMMUNOPHENOTYPING BY FLOW CYTOMETRY\n\n                     IMMUNOPHENOTYPE ANALYSIS\n% POS    MARKER  CLONE      EXPRESSION_______________________________\n98**    CD2    (39C1.5)    E-rosette T-cells, thymocytes, some NK cells, LFA-3 receptor.\n  1    CD3    (UCHT1)    T-cell antigen receptor associated, immunocompetent T-cells.\n  1    CD4    (T4)    T-helper cells, receptor for Class II and HIV antigens.\n94**    CD5    (BL1a)    All mature T-cells, mature thymocytes, B-cell subsets.\n98**    CD7    (8H8.1)    T-cells and NK cells.\n<1    CD8    (T8)    T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells, receptor for HLA Class I.\n  1    CD22    (SJ10.1H11)  Pan B-cell.\n  3    CD33    (D3HL60.251)  Early myeloid progenitors, myeloid cells, AML.\n  3    CD34    (581)    HPCA-2, Bone marrow progenitor cells, TdT+ cells, some \n            acute leukemias.\n12*    CD36    (FA6.152)  Platelets, megakaryocytes, monocytes, early erythroid cells.\n100*    CD45    (J.33)    Pan leukocytes, LCA.\n19+           CD56    (NKH-1)    Natural killer cells (CD3-).\n44*    CD71    (YDJ1.2.2)  Activated T and B-lymphocytes, macrophages, and \n            erythroblasts.\n  2    CD117    (104D2D1)  c-Kit, AML, CML in blast crisis, absent in ALL.\n39+    HLADR    (Immu-357)  MHC Class II HLA-DR, B-cells, monocytes, activated T-cells.\n\n*dim intensity\n+dim-moderate intensity\n**moderate intensity\n\nPOPULATION REPORTED:  CD45-DIM IMMATURE MONONUCLEAR POPULATION.  \n\nCOMMENT:  Flow cytometric evaluation shows a CD45 dim immature mononuclear population (smaller in size by light scatter; 70% of all cells) which expresses CD2, CD5, CD7, CD71 (dim), and HLA-DR (partial).

COMMENT: The sizes of these two invasive tumors identified in the left breast are difficult to determine with absolute certainty due to disruption from the prior biopsies:  Final staging must be performed by the oncologist/surgeon in correlation with all pathologic, imaging, surgical and clinical information.  See microscopic section below for summary of CAP Tumor Reporting protocol. **INITIALS  Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ], M.D., **NAME[YYY]\nGross Description 1:  Received fresh designated 'left sentinel lymph node' is fat containing two nodules consistent with lymph nodes measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm and 2.6 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm.  Each nodule is sectioned through the short axis and frozen in separate blocks with controls submitted as FSC1A and FSC1B.  CLS/in 2:  Received fresh designated \"left sentinel node\" is fat containing two separate nodules consistent with lymph nodes, measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, and 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm.  The smaller nodule is sectioned and entirely frozen in one block with control submitted as FSC2A.  The remaining nodule is sectioned and frozen in two blocks with controls submitted as FSC2B, and 2C.   **INITIALS 3:  Received in formalin labeled 'left breast is a 755 gram unoriented left simple mastectomy specimen having a small amount of contiguous axillary fat.  The axillary fat is utilized to orient the specimen.  The specimen is 21.1 cm from medial to lateral, 18.4 cm from superior to inferior and 5.4 cm from anterior to posterior.  The anterior surface is partially covered by 22.1 x 9.3 cm ellipse of white tan skin which includes a 3.9 cm pale areola and a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm nipple.  The nipple and areola are partially discolored by a blue dye.  8.8 cm lateral and slightly superior to the nipple there is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm purple red skin lesion.  3.3 cm superior to the nipple in the midline there is a 0.2 cm hyperemic area which may be a site of previous mammotome biopsy entry.  The skin is otherwise unremarkable.  The superior inferior soft tissue margins are composed of lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep margin is partially covered by fascia and shows no apparent skeletal muscle.  The superior soft tissue margin is inked blue the inferior soft tissue margin is inked yellow and the deep soft tissue margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned.  Two separate areas of previous biopsy are identified.  Within the medial inferior aspect of the upper inner quadrant there is a 1.0 cm in greatest dimension surgigel filled biopsy site having a metal clip within.  The adjacent tissue is mildly indurated but there is no grossly apparent residual tumor.  This biopsy site is 2.5 cm from the deep margin which is the closest margin.  Within the inferior medial aspect of the lower inner quadrant there is a 1.0 cm in greatest dimension surgigel filled biopsy site having an adjacent 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm area of induration.  This biopsy site is 1.5 cm from the inferior soft tissue margin which is the closest margin.  Although the tissue adjacent to the biopsy site is indurated there is no grossly apparent residual tumor.  The remainder of the breast is composed primarily of fat with focal strands of white fibrous-like.  Thorough examination of the tissues at what appears to be the upper outer quadrant reveals a solitary 1 cm lymph node candidate.  This is the only apparent lymph node with the specimen.  Detached but within the same container are four pieces of skin and unremarkable fatty tissue ranging from 6.1  11.7 cm in greatest dimension.  These weigh an additional 41 grams.  Sections are submitted as follows: 3A  nipple and areola 3B  skin lesion 3C  punctate area superior to nipple 3D through 3G  upper inner quadrant biopsy site with metal marker removed from block 3D 3H  deep margin closest to upper inner quadrant biopsy site 3I, J  tissue between upper inner quadrant and lower inner quadrant biopsy sites 3K through 3P  lower inner quadrant biopsy site and adjacent indurated tissue 3Q  inferior soft tissue margin closest to lower inner quadrant biopsy site 3R  representative section upper inner quadrant 2 cm from upper inner quadrant biopsy site 3S  representative section lower inner quadrant 1 cm medial to lower inner quadrant biopsy site 3T  representative section upper outer quadrant 3U  representative section lower outer quadrant 3V  serially sectioned axillary lymph node candidate The specimen was removed from the patient at 10:45 hr **DATE[Mar 9 12] and initially placed into formalin at 10:46 hrs 9/9 11.  The specimen is described sectioned and resubmitted into formalin at 12:59 hr **DATE[Mar 9 12]. LW/USO/CLS/in  4:  Received in formalin labeled \"right breast\" is a 21.1 x 18.3 x 5.3 cm, 736-gram unoriented simple mastectomy specimen.  The anterior surface is partially covered by a 21 x 11.5 cm ellipse of white tan skin which includes a 4.0 cm in greatest dimension pale areola with a central 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm nipple.  The skin shows a few purple red to waxy tan skin lesions ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  Several of the skin lesions come to within 0.4 cm of the skin margins. The exposed superficial soft tissue margins are composed of lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep margin is covered by fascia and shows a few thin and delicate strands of skeletal muscle.  The superficial margins are inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is then serially sectioned.  This shows predominantly fat with areas of white mammary tissue scattered within, primarily in the central portion of the breast.  No lesions are seen.  No lymph nodes are included with the specimen.  Sections are submitted as follows: 4A:  Nipple and areola. 4B, 4C:  Representative skin lesions and relationship to closest skin margin. 4D through 4K:  Two random sections from each quadrant. 4L:  Random section, central deep margin. The specimen was removed from the patient at 10:33 hours, **DATE[Mar 9 12], and initially placed into formalin at 10:34 hours, **DATE[Mar 9 12].  The specimen is described, sectioned and resubmitted into formalin at 14:02 hours, **DATE[Mar 9 12].   **INITIALS On **DATE[Mar 10 12], additional random sections of breast parenchyma are submitted in six blocks. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis. SUMMARY OF CAP TUMOR REPORTING PROTOCOL: Specimen: Left breast. Procedure: Mastectomy. Lymph Node Sampling: Sentinel lymph nodes and single low axillary lymph node in mastectomy. Specimen Integrity: Intact mastectomy. Tumor Focality: Two separate invasive tumors. Macroscopic and Microscopic Extent of Tumor:       Skin:  Carcinoma does not invade into the dermis or epidermis of skin.      Nipple: DCIS does not involve the nipple.                Skeletal Muscle: No skeletal muscle is present. Tumor Histologic Type / Upper Inner Quadrant: Invasive ductal carcinoma. Histologic Grade: Well differentiated/Grade I out of III (Nottingham score - tubule formation 2/3, nuclear pleomorphism 2/3,          mitotic activity 1/3; total score 5/9). Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: Intermediate nuclear grade ductal carcinoma in situ without central necrosis, solid and cribriform       patterns, extends beyond the invasive component to involve the upper and lower inner quadrants. Size of Invasive Tumor: 0.5 cm (see Comment). Tumor Histologic Type / Lower Inner Quadrant: Invasive ductal carcinoma. Histologic Grade: Moderately differentiated/Grade II out of III (Nottingham score - tubule formation 3/3, nuclear pleomorphism 2/3,          mitotic activity 1/3; total score 6/9). Size of Invasive Tumor: 0.3 cm (see Comment). Lymph/Vascular Space Invasion: Not identified. Margin Status: Margins are widely negative for malignancy (closest deep and superficial inferior margins measure 2.5 and 1.5 cm      respectively). Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined: 4.  Number of Non-sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined: 1.  Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Micrometastasis: 1. Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Macrometastasis: 0.

CD38 is expressed on <30% of clonal B-cells. This\nimmunophenotype and limited morphologic findings are characteristic for\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  If the patient does not have a\npreviously established diagnosis of CLL/SLL, the current requirement for\nthis diagnosis includes an absolute monoclonal B-cell count >5 x 10(9)/L,\nor the presence of extramedullary tissue involvement, cytopenias or disease\nrelated symptoms (WHO classification 2008).  The alternative diagnosis is\nmonoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) with a CLL-like phenotype, which has\nbeen shown to progress to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of \\R\\1% per year\n(Rawstron et al NEJM 2008; **ID-NUM). If diagnostic criteria for CLL are\nmet, then the absence of CD38 expression is associated with better outcome.\n(Ref. Matrai Z. Hematology 2005;10:39-46; Boonstra JG et al,\n2006;**ID-NUM). Clinical and morphologic correlation is required for\ncomplete interpretation of these findings, with periodic blood monitoring\nrecommended if clinically warranted.\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a prominent population of small and\nintermediate lymphocytes with mature chromatin. Unremarkable neutrophils\nare observed with subsets of monocytes and occasional eosinophils.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3  CD4  CD5  CD8  CD10  CD19  CD20\nCD23  CD33  CD34  CD38  CD45  FMC7  kappa  lambda\n\nBlasts:\nNo significant increase in CD34+ blasts identified.\n\nLymphoid population:\nSurface immunoglobulin negative B-cell population identified, see comment\nabove. These cells do not express CD10 or FMC7.\n\nApproximately 13% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 4:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression with the antibodies\nexamined.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nThe majority of recorded events are CD33 positive maturing myeloid cells.\n\nMonocytes identified by forward and side scatter characteristics, in\nconjunction with CD4 and CD33 coexpression, comprise 2% of total events.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.

Tumor cells grow in nested sheets\nlike groups and are composed of cells with enlarged moderate pleomorphic\nnuclei often with one or more prominent nucleolus. The cells have variable\namounts of amphophilic cytoplasm. In some areas there is a suggestion of\nintercellular bridges between some cells. Areas of the tumor are necrotic.\nOther areas are surrounded by dense fibrous tissues. \nA panel of immunohistochemical marker stains has been performed. This\nconfirms a squamous phenotype for this neoplasm. The neoplastic cells show\ndiffuse and strong positive immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 5/6. There is\npositive nuclear immunoreactivity for p63. These same cells are negative\nwith stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, TTF-1 and CDX2. Appropriate\ninternal controls are preset on some of these negative stains. \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC) REPORT:\nANTIBODIES:RESULTS: \n1.   CYTOKERATIN 7 (OV-TL12/30): NEGATIVE.\n2.

Localization is via a biotin-free multimer-based\nimmunoperoxidase technique according to an optimized protocol. The\ncontrols are reviewed for the appropriate positive and negative reactivity\nand found to be satisfactory.

There is a 2.5 opened vascular margin (vein) exuding yellow-tan friable tumor.  The surface of the specimen consists of yellow-tan perinephric adipose tissue with focal Gerota's fascia.  The previously mentioned vascular margin is shaved.  The renal artery is identified and appears free of tumor.  The ureter is identified and the margin is shaved.  The ureter measures 9.0 cm in length and is 0.5 cm in diameter and is dissected to the level of the renal pelvis and fails to reveal distinct tumor involvement.  The specimen is marked with black ink and bivalved to reveal the kidney to measure 19.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm.  There is a bulky, yellow-tan, partially gelatinous, hemorrhagic tumor mass identified within the kidney.  The tumor completely replaces the lower pole and extends into the upper pole of the kidney.  The tumor measures 15.0 x 10.5 x 10.0 cm.  Tumor grossly appears to involve the renal sinus adipose tissue and fills the calyceal system of the kidney, with tumor calyceal extension noted in the upper pole.  The tumor is located to within less than 0.1 cm of the overlying inked surface.  The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is tan and unremarkable.  The adrenal gland is identified and measures 6.8 x 3.0 x up to 1.0 cm.  There is a 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm cortical nodule.  The adrenal gland does not appear to be involved by the tumor.  Two possible lymph node candidates are identified within the renal pelvis measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.

The ureter measures 9.0 cm in length and is 0.5 cm in diameter and is dissected to the level of the renal pelvis and fails to reveal distinct tumor involvement.  The specimen is marked with black ink and bivalved to reveal the kidney to measure 19.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm.  There is a bulky, yellow-tan, partially gelatinous, hemorrhagic tumor mass identified within the kidney.  The tumor completely replaces the lower pole and extends into the upper pole of the kidney.  The tumor measures 15.0 x 10.5 x 10.0 cm.  Tumor grossly appears to involve the renal sinus adipose tissue and fills the calyceal system of the kidney, with tumor calyceal extension noted in the upper pole.  The tumor is located to within less than 0.1 cm of the overlying inked surface.  The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is tan and unremarkable.  The adrenal gland is identified and measures 6.8 x 3.0 x up to 1.0 cm.  There is a 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm cortical nodule.  The adrenal gland does not appear to be involved by the tumor.  Two possible lymph node candidates are identified within the renal pelvis measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  Multiple representative sections from the specimen are submitted as follows: 1.        renal vein margin with tumor 2.        renal artery and ureter margin 3-5.        tumor and renal sinus adipose tissue 6-9.        multiple representative sections of tumor and overlying inked peripheral surface 10\\T\\11.        representative sections of tumor and adherent perinephric adipose tissue   12\\T\\13.        representative sections of tumor within calyx 14.        unremarkable kidney parenchyma 15.        two lymph node candidates 16.        adrenal gland 17.        section of adrenal cortical nodule    **INITIALS  COPIES TO: **NAME[ZZZ,YYY M] 2355 Poplar Level Rd **PLACE, KY **ZIP-CODE  **PHONE  **NAME[XXX,WWW M] 101 Hospital Blvd **PLACE, IN **ZIP-CODE  **PHONE  PROCEDURES: 88307GS/2  Signed __________(signature on file)___________ **NAME[VVV M UUU] MD **DATE[Feb 16 12]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RUN DATE:**DATE[Feb 20 12]                 **PLACE Clinical Associates                        \n"

Mild normochromic, normocytic anemia\nDiagnosisComment:\nPer EPIC, the patient has a prior diagnosis of a CD20-positive, follicular lymphoma, grade 3A out of 3 from a **DATE[Apr 15 12] excisional biopsy of left axillary lymphadenopathy. \n\nFor the current bone marrow biopsy, the histologic and immunohistochemical findings show scattered, small B cells (10% of total cells).  A rare, loose, paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate is seen (see second photo).  The flow cytometry study identifies an atypical population of small B cells (although light chain restriction is not established).  Lastly, the cytogenetics data demonstrates a deletion in chromosome 11 in a subset of the cells (although this finding is not pathognomonic for any disease).  Collectively, these findings raise the suspicion, but are not definitive for, bone marrow involvement by a CD20-positive mature B cell lymphoma.\n\nWith the available data, a definitive diagnosis of a follicular lymphoma is not currently rendered because of 1)  the low level marrow involvement by the B cells (approximately only 10% of the total cells), 2) lack of a definitive population of light chain-restricted B cells by flow cytometry, 3) lack of a typical histologic pattern with corroborating immunohistochemical staining (i.e., BCL-2, BCL-6), and 4) lack of a typical t(14;18) genetic abnormality by cytogenetics.\nAdditional fluorescence in situ hybridization studies and molecular immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement studies are pending, and these results will be incorporated as Addenda for a final diagnosis.\n\n\nAlso, stainable marrow iron is rare.  If indicated, consider correlation with serologic studies.\n\nPlease also see the concurrent flow cytometry immunophenotyping report (PPPL at HMC **NAME[ZZZ] Flow Cytometry Laboratory, ***PATH-NUMBER[1]) and concurrent cytogenetics report (Ohana Genetics, **ID-NUM). |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in two containers in fixative labeled \"XXXXXX, XXXXXX\"\n\nA.  Container A labeled \"aspirate clot\" specimen consists of an estimate of 1.5 cc brown blood clot.  Totally submitted in \n  cassette A.\n\nB.  Container B labeled \"bone marrow biopsy\" consists of one core biopsy of hard tan and brown bone measuring 1.7 cm in \n  length.  Totally decalcified for 5 minutes in TBD-1 decal.  Totally submitted in cassette B.\nA: Bone marrow, aspiration (clot section)\nB: Bone marrow, biopsy, right posterior iliac crest\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nA.   Bone marrow, aspiration:  \n    1.    Bone marrow with an atypical B cell population (see Addendum Comment)\n    2.  B cell clonality detection by PCR:  Insufficient DNA isolated (see Addendum Comment)\n    3.    BCL6 rearrangement by FISH:  Not detected\n    4.    IGH/BCL2 translocation by FISH:  Not detected.\nAddendumComment:\nThis Addendum is created to incorporate an additional molecular B cell clonality and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies.\n\nA B cell clonality detection study (immunoglobulin gene rearrangement) by PCR was conducted to help identify a clonal B cell population.  However, insufficient DNA was isolated; and this study provides no additional data.\n\nFISH studies examining for a BCL6 rearrangement and an IGH/BCL2 translocation were not detected.  \n\nIn summary, 1) the atypical morphologic findings of the bone marrow biopsy (i.e., rare paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate with numerous B cells), 2) atypical findings by flow cytometry (i.e. CD5-negative/CD10-negative B cells comprising 40% of lymphocytes/7-8% of total cells and with non-specific light chain staining), and 3) deletion in chromosome 11 in a subset of the cells are all findings which raise the suspicion for involvement by a low-grade mature B cell lymphoma.  However, these findings are not definitive for a diagnosis of malignancy.  The additional molecular B cell clonality study and FISH studies do not provide any further support for a clonal B cell population.  \n\nIt is possible that the lack of definitive data is related to sampling or the sensitivity of the molecular and FISH tests.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in the original Comments, a definitive diagnosis of a follicular lymphoma is not currently rendered because of 1) the low level marrow involvement by the B cells (approximately only 10% of the total cells), 2) lack of a definitive population of light chain-restricted B cells by flow cytometry, 3) lack of a diagnostic histologic pattern with corroborating immunohistochemical staining (i.e., BCL-2, BCL-6), 4) lack of a typical t(14;18) genetic abnormality by cytogenetics, and 5) lack of a detectable IGH/BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement.\n\nPlease also see Clarient reports ***PATH-NUMBER[2] (B cell clonality detection) and ***PATH-NUMBER[3] (FISH studies).\n"

The case is sent to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] for consultation, result is pending. |\nGrossDescription:\nSpecimen received I n fixative labeled with the patient's name and \"skin lesion right thigh\" consists of a 3-mm punch biopsy of white skin and a fragment of underlying tan soft tissue measuring up to 0.4 cm in maximum dimension.  The punch biopsy is bisected and along with the smaller tan fragment of tissue totally submitted in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe punch biopsy of skin shows diffuse lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis.  The lymphocytes appear monotonous.  The epidermis is not involved.\nA: Right thigh, punch biopsy of skin\nAddendumDiagnosis:\n\"Right Thigh Tissue ***PATH-NUMBER[1]:  Clonal Rearrangement Detected\".\n\nSkin lesion right thigh:  CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (see comments).\n\nComments:  The majority of the lymphoid cells are of T-cell lineage (CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7-neg, CD8-neg, CD30+, CD56-neg, ALK-neg and EMA-neg), admixed with rare B-cells (PAX-5+).  CD10 and CD21 are negative.  S-100, Melan-A, and pankeratin are negative as well.\n\nHistologic differential diagnosis:\n  Primary cutaneus ALCL (ALK-negative, EMA-negative, CD4-positive)\n  Secondary ALCL from MF, Hodgkin's, etc (ALK-negative, EMA-negative)\n  Lymphomatoid papulosis (ALK-negative, EMA-negative, CD4-positive)\n\n  Less likely Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS and CD30-positive mycosis fungoides (tumor stage)\n\nClinicopathologic correlation is suggested.\nAddendumComment:\nBoth Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW] and Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] reviewed the slides and agree with the above diagnosis.\n\n\"Comment:  A clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangement was identified by PCR.  T cell clonality can be seen in neoplastic as well as reactive processes, particularly in the setting of restricted immune responses.  The diagnosis of lymphoma cannot be made solely on this result; therefore, these results should be interpreted in the context of clinical, histologic and immunophenotypic findings.\"\n\nAddendum Diagnosis and Comment were given on the Clarient T-Cell Clonality Detection by PCR (TCR-beta and TCR-gamma PCR) Report of **DATE[May 20 2012] (Accession No. **ID-NUM).\n"

Received in the fresh state for frozen section and designated as \\\"biopsy of mass upper lobe left lung\\\" is a somewhat rubbery to fleshy reddish-gray to gray-tan nodular tissue fragment measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for frozen section in 1 block. Material used in frozen section diagnosis was resubmitted in toto for embedding in block A. D: **DATE[Oct 10 2012] - 1704 hours BHT T: **DATE[Oct 10 2012] - 1726 hours B. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis of bronchial margin and designated \\\"left upper lobe - left lung\\\" are 3 separate segments of pulmonary tissue weighing 230 g in aggregate. The pleural surfaces are wrinkled and a dark reddish-purple. Mild to moderate amounts of subpleural anthracotic pigment deposition are seen. Multiple surgically clipped lines of surgical resection are seen. The 8 x 5 x 3 cm segment of pulmonary tissue demonstrates disruption of the pleural surface. Approximately 5 mm deep to the pleural surface is a well-circumscribed, lobulated, light tan nodule. The bronchial margin is submitted in block B1. Section of pleura overlying the mass is submitted in block B2. Sections of tissue from the clipped margins of surgical resection from this segment of pulmonary tissue are submitted in block B3. The mass is very well circumscribed and appears to pop away from the surrounding pulmonary tissue. The mass has overall dimensions of 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. The mass is slightly soft. The cut surface demonstrates a homogeneous, ivory-colored appearance. The mass is submitted in toto in blocks B4 and B5. Areas of necrosis are not grossly identified upon sectioning. Sectioning through the remainder of this segment of pulmonary tissue reveals no additional masses. The cut surface is dark red, and blood oozes upon sectioning. A random section of lung from this segment of tissue is submitted in block B6. The largest segment of pulmonary tissue is 15 x 6 x 0.9 cm. The vascular margins of surgical resection are submitted in block B7. Surgically clipped lines of resection are seen, and tissue taken from these areas is submitted in block B8. Sectioning through the pulmonary tissue from this segment reveals dark red rubbery tissue. Blood oozes upon sectioning. A random section of lung from this segment is submitted in block B9. Two peribronchial anthracotic lymph nodes are identified, measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Tumor is not grossly identified in these lymph nodes. One-half of each lymph node is submitted in block B10. The remaining segment of pulmonary tissue is 8.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm. A surgically clipped line of resection is seen, and tissue from this area is submitted in block B11. Sectioning reveals beefy red tissue. Nodules or masses are not seen. A representative section is submitted in block B12. C. Submitted in formalin and designated \\\"peribronchial lymph node - left\\\" is an anthracotic lymph node measuring 2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. A calcified nodule is identified upon bisectioning, and this nodule is 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in block C for decalcification. D. Submitted in formalin and designated \\\"level 5 node\\\" is a 1.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is bisected and both halves are submitted in block D. D: **DATE[Oct 11 2012] - 1617 hours T: **DATE[Oct 13 2012] - 1458 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION A. Step sections of the biopsy of the mass from the upper lobe of left lung reveal histologic features consistent with typical carcinoid tumor. The tumor is arranged as rounded and angulated nests of cells. Moderate to abundant amounts of granular pink cytoplasm are seen. The nuclei are rather uniform and an occasional inconspicuous nucleolus is seen. Mitotic activity is very low with only a rare mitotic figure identified. Necrosis is not seen. B. Step sections of the bronchial margin of surgical resection from the left upper lobe of lung reveal no evidence of malignancy. The bronchus is lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The submucosal glands are unremarkable. Sections from the surgically clipped parenchymal margins of surgical resection reveal no evidence of neoplasia. Many macrophages are seen in the alveolar spaces and many of these macrophages contain anthracotic pigment. Step sections of the left upper lobe of lung mass reveal histologic changes of typical carcinoid. Large groups of cells are seen demonstrating moderate to abundant amounts of granular amphophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are generally round to oval and demonstrate a stippled chromatin pattern. Mitotic activity is low. Focal nuclear pleomorphism is seen. Necrosis is not identified. The tumor may be seen undermining bronchial mucosa. Immunohistochemical stains performed at Genzyme confirm neuroendocrine differentiation. A random section of lung reveals no evidence of neoplasia. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage is seen. Scattered foci of anthracotic pigment deposition are seen. Anthracotic laden macrophages may be seen within alveolar spaces. Sections of the vascular margins of surgical resection reveal no evidence of neoplasia. Sections of the peribronchial lymph nodes reveal 2 out of 2 lymph nodes to be negative for metastatic malignancy. There is prominent sinus histiocytosis. Sections from the remaining segments of lung tissue, including the parenchymal margins of surgical resection, reveal no evidence of neoplasia. Hemorrhage is seen within alveolar spaces. Anthracotic pigment laden macrophages are also seen within alveolar spaces. There is scattered anthracotic pigment deposition. Emphysematous changes are seen with coalescence of alveolar spaces noted. C. Step sections of the left peribronchial lymph node reveal a lymph node demonstrating a hyalinized and calcified nodule compatible with a remote granuloma. Sinus histiocytosis is also seen within the lymph node. There is no evidence of metastatic malignancy. D. Sections of the level V lymph node reveal no histologic evidence of malignancy. There is prominent medullary sinus histiocytosis. Many of the histiocytes contain anthracotic pigment.

Smears show scant large cells that are morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to malignant cells identified in the pleural effusion specimens (***PATH-NUMBER[1], ***PATH-NUMBER[2], and ***PATH-NUMBER[3]).  Due to scant cellularity, immunohistochemical stains were performed in combination with slides from CSF sample ***PATH-NUMBER[4].  The large cells are positive for TTF-1, CK7, and MOC-31 stains.  Background inflammatory cells are negative for these stains.  Calretinin stain is negative.  The findings are consistent with involvement of CSF by malignant cells of pulmonary adenocarcinoma origin.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived labeled \"CSF #2\" is 2.0 cc of colorless and clear fluid.  The fluid is centrifuged and the resulting cell pellet is submitted for cytology and cell block (one cassette). \n\n4 PPPL prepared cytospin slides (Pap stained) and 1 cell block (combined with \"CSF #1\" specimen from Microbiology).\nA: Cerebrospinal fluid #2\n"

Addendum Comment Per request from Dr. **NAME[SSS], slides and blocks are pulled from the archive and reviewed. Block A1 with tumor is used for EGFR mutation analysis **NAME[RRR] MD **PLACE (see previous addendum). Block A2 is used for RRM1. Unstained slides are prepared with the Response Genetics protocol for small biopsies (non-charged, 7 microns, made with PCR precautions). A follow up H\\T\\E shows the tissue is beginning to be cut through, but there are still several tumor glands available for analysis (and the first sections have more tissue). Microdissection may be required to increase the percentage of tumor cell RNA. Slides will be sent to Response Genetics for RRM1 normalized quantitation.

EGFR mutation analysis in exons 19-21 was negative, therefore the regular cut and mount slides from block A1 will be sent for ALK rearrangement analysis by FISH. No H\\T\\E slide was prepared; however, these cut and mount slides were sandwiched by H\\T\\E slides showing tumor. There is fibrosis and chronic inflammation in the sections with intermixed tumor glands and care will be needed to avoid counting these cells; therefore the block is considered to be borderline adequate for FISH analysis. Slides will be sent to the University of **PLACE for ALK rearrangement testing. This service has been rendered in part by a resident.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES BY PHENOPATH LABORATORIES PENDING, ADDENDUM REPORT WILL FOLLOW.\n**INITIALS<CLINICAL INFO>\nBrain tumor.<ADDENDUM COMMENTS>\nThis case was sent to PhenoPath Laboratories in **PLACE, Washington. Their results are as follows:\n\nBRAIN TUMOR: METASTATIC SARCOMATOID CARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH ORIGIN FROM LUNG (SEE COMMENTS).\n\nCOMMENTS:\nThe results of the immunohistochemistry panel for this poorly differentiated mixed sarcomatoid and epithelioid malignancy confirm the suspicion of a metastatic carcinoma (uniformly positive with pancytokeratins OSCAR), and given the provided clinical history, are considered consistent with a metastasis from the patient's known lung carcinoma. Spindle cell carcinomas of the lung typically show no expression of lung organ-specific markers (such as TTF-1), as exemplified in this particular case. Otherwise, there is no evidence for a melanoma (negative S100/HMB45), myogenic sarcoma (negative desmin), vascular sarcoma (negative CD34), or an astrocytic malignancy (negative GFAP).\n\nReference is made to their complete report (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).\n(**INITIALS **DATE[Feb 15 2012])\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nBRAIN TUMOR: \nAll of the tissue is examined on three slides. It shows a partially necrotic high grade spindle cell tumor composed of pleomorphic tumor cells with intervening neutrophils and areas of geographic tumor necrosis. The tumor is similar to the patient's prior lung mass (***PATH-NUMBER[2]). The case will be sent in follow-up to PhenoPath Laboratories for additional immunohistochemical studies and an addendum report will follow.PATHOLOGIST:\nInsalaco S J\n"

The remainder of the tissue is wrapped and\nresubmitted in its entirety in E1.\nF.   Container designation: \"left lung/bronchial margins\" --  Received\nfresh is a 600 gram left pnemonectomy, with specimen measuring in overall\ndimensions as 24 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm, with multiple staple margins along the\nhilar surface, one measuring 2.3 cm enclosing the mainstem bronchus, this\narea is inked blue.  The staple margin is removed, with the shaved\nbronchial resection margin submitted for frozen section diagnosis and\nentirely resubmitted in cassette F1.  The pleural surface throughout is\nsmooth without puckering, a large tumor mass is palpated along the medial\nanterior surface, this pleural surface is inked green. Sectioning through\nthis nodular area reveals a white/yellow, firm tumor mass measuring 3.5 x\n3.5 x 2.7 cm, appearing well demarcated, at a distance of 0.1 cm of the\noverlying pleural surface, with tumor invading through an area of the\nmainstem bronchial cartilage, partially obliterating the lumen, with tumor\nat a distance of 1.3 cm to the bronchial resection margin. Further\nsectioning reveals possible tumor distal involvement of upper lobe\nbronchus. Sectioning through the remainder of the lung parenchyma reveals\nno other discrete nodular tumor masses with widespread bronchiolar\ndilatations filled with thick yellow mucin plugs.  Portions of tissue are\nsubmitted for the XXXXX, including tumor, tumor\nand leading edge, adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma, and distant\nuninvolved lung parenchyma.   Representative sections are submitted as\nfollows:  F2, vascular resection margins; F3, two perihilar whole lymph\nnode uninked; F4, three whole perihilar lymph nodes; F5, section of tumor\narea with portion of mainstem bronchus and inked pleural surface; F6, two\nsections of tumor area involving main and upper lobe bronchus; F7, another\nsection of tumor and inked overlying pleura; F8, another section of\npossible tumor involving upper lobe bronchus; F9, tumor, adjacent vessels\nand uninvolved lung parenchyma; F10, three sections of uninvolved lung\nparenchyma with areas of anthracotic pigment with dilated mucin plugged\nbronchi.\nG.

The largest specimen is bisected, and submitted in toto in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  The microscopic description supports the above diagnoses.\n\nB.  The microscopic description supports the above diagnoses.\n\nC.  The hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections demonstrate fragments of oxyntic mucosa.  The lamina propria shows a mild increase in neutrophils with rare neutrophils found in the superficial epithelium.  There is an abnormal infiltrate of intermediate-sized cells with hyperchromatic nuclei found in the deeper aspect of the mucosa of one fragment.  These abnormal cells have varying nuclear contour shapes and scant cytoplasm.  Adjacent and interspersed small lymphocytes are present among the abnormal cells.  No mucosal ulceration or necrosis is seen.  Immunohistochemical stains were conducted. The abnormal cells label with CD56 and synaptophysin (weak).  The abnormal cells do not stain with chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase (NSE), Ber-EP4, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, polyclonal CEA, TTF-1, CDX2, PSA, CD45 (LCA), CD3, and CD138 (positive controls intact).  \n\nNote:  Preliminary results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[M. ZZZ] on **DATE[May 22 2012].\nA: Gastric biopsy mass, greater curvature\nB: Gastric biopsy mass, lesser curvature\nC: Gastric biopsy mass, cardia lesser curvature\nAddendumComment:\nThis Addendum is created to incorporate additional immunohistochemical staining results for part C.\n\nFor Part C (cardia lesser curvature), additional immunohistochemical stains were conducted in an attempt to further characterize the neoplasm.  Unfortunately, the small amount of neoplastic cells in the original hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections does not appear in the deeper, immunohistochemically stained tissue sections (conducted for this Addendum), thereby precluding further characterization.  \n\nThe morphologic features and the prior immunohistochemical stains (i.e., CD56 and synaptophysin) suggest a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm, favoring small cell carcinoma.  However, in the absence of a full immunohistochemical work-up, other malignancies (i.e., atypical forms of hematopoietic neoplasms, gastrointestinal stromal tumor) cannot be definitively excluded.\n\nIf indicated, consider submission of more tissue/sampling of tumor to aid the diagnosis.  \n\n\nAddendum Microscopic Description\nFor Part C, additional immunohistochemical staining was conducted to further characterize the neoplasm.  PAX-5, CD20, CD34, CD99 (MIC 2), CD117, TdT, S100, and Ki-67 (positive controls intact) were conducted.  However, no neoplastic cells are present for staining in the deeper tissue sections.\n"

Labeled with name: **NAME[AAA\nBBB].\nA.   Container designation: \"rectosigmoid colon\" --  The specimen consists\nof a 17.5 cm (post-fixation) segment of rectosigmoid colon varying in\ncircumference from 4 to 6 cm with attached fatty tissue measuring up to 6\ncm in maximal thickness.  The radial margin of the specimen consists of\nserosa with epiploic fat for the upper 6.5 cm transitioning to adventitia\nfor the lower 11 cm.  The epiploic fat is inked green and the deep\nadventitia is inked black and blue.  Opening of the bowel demonstrates a\nred to dark brown, circular mass lesion with heaped borders arising in the\nbowel mucosa and measuring 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm (deep).  The mass is 7 cm\nfrom the closest (distal) margin pre-fixation (3.5 cm post-fixation), 11 cm\nfrom the proximal margin (post-fixation), and 1.7 cm from the\ncircumferential margin (post-fixation).  The mass appears to expand the\nbowel mucosa without invading into the pericolonic adipose tissue.\nApproximately 15 polyps are identified on the bowel mucosa, both proximal\nand distal to the mass lesion, and measuring up to 0.7 cm in greatest\ndiameter. The remaining bowel mucosa is otherwise unremarkable. Examination\nof the attached pericolonic fat reveals multiple presumed lymph nodes,\nranging from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest diameter.
